Unknown User (2025-01-14 17:27:19): Forging a path to stock market success demands a steadfast commitment to remaining invested over the long term. Consider this: a $10,000 investment made two decades ago would now be worth a remarkable $63,636. On the other hand, an investor who missed out on just 30 of the best days in that period would see their investment grow only to $11,484—a stark contrast that underscores the importance of consistency and patience over timing.

Unknown User (2025-01-14 04:05:16): 4.25% is still a high interest rate for corporations compared to 2%. I would think Q4 earnings aren't going to be great for many corporations. And the guidence for most corporation will not be great either with Fed only to cut later on this year instead of earlier causing corps to continue to live with high interest rates. And then there is the uncertainty of trump tariffs.

He is not going to fix immigration or grocery prices. He Just keeps threatening, gets money from whoever he can extract it from and keeps fans happy by making them think he is so powerful for the next four years . By the time they realize his wicked plans he has already made lot of money and his 4 years are over. He makes so much money so that he can buy entire judicial system and get rid of all court cases for the crimes he committed in these 4 years.

---All in, 9/11 had WTC economic costs of $33-38 billion. 24 years of inflation, at 4%, that's approximately $100b
...Assuming the fires do cost $175b, which may be on the low end because its not just the houses/Cars/material possessions, but these are some of the most productive people on the planet getting displaced. Alot of those people own Bitcoin, NVDA, AMZN, etc, probably need to sell some to liquidate. Insurance/reinsurance may

They flew them, or they knew who flew them, and had to wait till the objective was completed. After all, if they wanted to catch who was doing it, why would they tell the world when and where the trackers would be set up. Satelite imagery saw where everyone landed. Drones give all heat. All motors do. They saw where the trucks and boats where they were stored were being unloaded, and being reloaded. You and I can't see in the dark. But the military and satellites can. And have been for years. Trucks full of these drones are probably enroute to another area, for another mission.

Unknown User (2024-12-30 03:57:43): It looks like the S&P may still be pushed to a new high - then the rug pull begins.  Don’t get lured if they push it up - it’s a trap.

Unknown User (2024-12-29 01:43:03): Well, there is one thing all AMZN investors agree on, and that is that $223 is the bottom. There is only one way for it to go from here, and that is up. The sky is the limit. In fact, the Snow Clown reiterates $226 by New Year's Day and $229 by Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Who knows, we could hit $232 by Groundhog Day.🤡
Unknown User (2024-12-29 01:28:42): How alluring are equities to institutions? Zero. The equity risk premium in the market is basically the same for bonds as it is for equities. Meaning, if one buys stocks today they better hope for insane profit growth to net any return. And that the market believes equity and bonds have the same risk - which is absolutely insane. The equity risk premium is so out of balance it hasn't seen these levels in decades. Why is this important to you? Because I 100% guarantee you pension funds, institutions are selling equity and buying bonds - or they will be very very soon. When the market is valuing risk equivalently between bonds and equities (investors are being paid $0 to take on all the risk with equity) why would anyone take on equity risk when they could buy bonds risk free and get nearly the same return? If you could choose A and get 7% with huge risk (stocks) or you could choose B and get 6% (bonds) with little to no risk which would you choose? Enjoy!

Unknown User (2024-12-23 23:02:39): Thousands of Amazon workers at a Staten Island warehouse walked off the job, joining the tens of thousands of employees in other states on strike to protest unfair labor practices. Meanwhile, Starbucks workers expanded their strike to New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia and St. Louis.

Unknown User (2024-12-23 20:06:05): Keep striking - anywhere there are unions involved they are uninvestable. Unions cost the consumer more.

Rob (2024-12-23 08:02:18): Volume was pretty high Friday good momentum into close and after hours. I don’t think the strike will have much effect, except when Amazon starts to layoff striking workers. 
JRD (2024-12-23 07:43:28): Futures up-- it doesn't mean a thing, or does it?  
I liked Friday's close, love closing on a higher price with markets dropping. 
New high this week?  I think so unless bad news about strike comes out.  
Unknown User (2024-12-23 07:37:09): The mother of all rallies tomorrow. Shorts will be scorched

Unknown User (2024-12-21 07:48:38): a broken clock is right twice daily .  tell me when?  and i will be ready
Unknown User (2024-12-21 07:33:30): The market is now knocking on the door of collapse - it will happen very soon.  The DOW has topped, the Qs are rolling over (and will soon), and the S&P will follow.  The US is heading into recession and may very well be in recession now.  Hope you used today to sell or hedge though seasonality may allow retail to chase it higher (foolish) if that happens you better use that to your advantage or you will deeply regret it.  Sorry
JRD (2024-12-21 05:57:44): It's very positive AMZN closed up today.  Not much, but that's ok. 
We don't want a straight line up to the moon. That's no good. 
You want to form " handles". 
Unless you're a trader.  I'm not. 
Rob (2024-12-21 05:08:16): Thankfully the market didn’t sell off like yesterday.
Finished green!!
All have a good weekend 
Unknown User (2024-12-21 05:06:45): I agree, but at least the volume on an up day was strong.
Unknown User (2024-12-21 04:59:55): Up 10.75% for the past 30 days.  Your personal greed is showing. 

Just chill and show some patience 
Unknown User (2024-12-21 04:46:37): Tough week ending with a whimper. Wednesday's thrashing going to be tough to make back up.

Unknown User (2024-12-21 04:37:18): Thanks to the fed, it’s likely to be a krappy end of year for many of these tech heavyweights.
Rob (2024-12-21 04:22:35): Good luck 
Unknown User (2024-12-21 04:16:03): Will run up to 226 near the close.
Unknown User (2024-12-21 02:57:49): POOP!
Unknown User (2024-12-22 01:03:35): after the holidays business will slow down and holiday temp workers laid off. 
Rob (2024-12-21 04:34:38): You might be right keep watching 
Unknown User (2024-12-21 02:16:11): it's possible but why in a 850 plus market 
JRD (2024-12-21 02:14:29): Red close?  I can smell the blood. 
Unknown User (2024-12-21 03:33:54): The main reason would be probably "the strikes" launched by Teamsters.  Although Amazon said the strike would not affect its delivery operation for holidays, still it creates some uncertainty.  If by the end of the day, Amazon goes up further, then things should be better in the next coming weeks.  Otherwise, we still have a merry Christmas, don't we ? 
Unknown User (2024-12-21 02:05:40): Nasdaq is up +1.69%, but AMZN is only up +.43%.
Lots of peeps taking profits.

Unknown User (2024-12-20 23:54:34): Buy on dip
Unknown User (2024-12-21 00:26:02): People I know are not fans of Amazon but buy from them because of product availability and the low price. They aren't going anywhere else.
Unknown User (2024-12-20 23:43:41): We won’t see the full effect of the strike on sales numbers for a couple weeks. Most likely panic from buyers and if their package is delayed and need it before the holiday, they will purchase from another vendor and either cancel or return their amazon order. If they get good service from another vendor, they may never come back to amazon. It’s basic knowledge in sales. If a product or service is not available, people don’t stop buying, they just get something else.
Unknown User (2024-12-20 23:28:03): It’s a very small percentage of workers that will basically affect nothing aka a big yawn.
Unknown User (2024-12-20 23:16:22): Who cares about the Amazon employees going on strike. They will be replaced with robots soon enough 
Unknown User (2024-12-20 23:43:06): Don't expect logic or truth from the Teamsters
Expect violence , lies, and deception.

I speak from experience
Unknown User (2024-12-20 23:01:44): How is a non employee delivery guy striking Amazon? Is this a new union tactic.
Unknown User (2024-12-21 00:09:05): I'm out at 333

Unknown User (2024-12-20 22:54:12): upgrade after upgrade. As long as the President and Trump don't tank the market Amazon is on it's way to 300 by end of 2025.

Unknown User (2024-12-20 21:58:30): The run from $200 to $230 was based on FOMO hype and therefore will be given back.

Today's Pre market is down already by another 1000 points. Let's see what would would happens to all of our stocks. Since election day won by President Elon (not Trump), his net worth doubled to $425 Billions! As you know, Elon invested $270 millions on this election. He knew exactly what he was doing and if he doesn't get stopped, he will become the first South African (Yes. He is not an American) Trillionaire in the world. Only retails (you and I) will pay for Elon's lack of knowledge of politics.

Unknown User (2024-12-20 00:50:20): Amazon will replace them all with Robots and Drones. Those strikes are just accelerating the process. The Market likes that 
Boeing is up 25% since the end of the strike. the stock will double in 1 to 2 years. Enough time to replace those strikers with technology   
Unknown User (2024-12-20 00:39:11): SO BOEING STRIKES STOCK TANKS
AMAZON STRIKES STOCK GOES UP 
Unknown User (2024-12-20 00:53:20): They will probably hire employees to fly the drones and say it’s automated. Kind of like their failed self check out tech where they paid a bunch of guys in india to watch the video tapes to see what was put in the cart lol
Unknown User (2024-12-20 00:47:33): it's coming 😏
Unknown User (2024-12-20 00:38:25): Replace them all with robots and drones. Union garbage 
Unknown User (2024-12-20 00:35:27): why?
Unknown User (2024-12-20 00:22:31): They change stop points all the time to correct the system. Nothing illegal about it. 
Unknown User (2024-12-20 00:16:51): Imagine firing the Amazon drivers for changing the drop points.
Imagine jail time.
Unknown User (2024-12-20 00:11:19): Imagine the drivers just don’t strike but actually change the drop points in the amazon app of where to leave the packages. If they move to drones and robots, then they would be using that info to deliver and it would be chaos lol.  
Unknown User (2024-12-20 00:06:29): Everybody out of the pool 🏊‍♀️

Unknown User (2024-12-20 00:06:21): careful these guys are on strike 
Unknown User (2024-12-20 00:01:36): I love seeing all the people calling the delivery drivers that deliver their packages unskilled and replaceable. If that’s the case then just replace them and no need to worry about the strike I guess. Keep rolling through these workers and there won’t be any drivers to hire which will force prices to go up and delays in shipping. Better get those drones up and ready but I don’t think they will be as effective as they think. I know a delivery driver and he said the location of where to deliver often misses the mark of where the package should be placed and even one time prompted him to deliver the package in a lake lol. Obviously he didn’t because he’s human but a drone or robot won’t know the difference.
Unknown User (2024-12-20 00:08:58): The institutional ownership on this one is crazy so you’re probably right. The rug pool is gonna be hard, but there are true believers here so you know.

Unknown User (2024-12-19 22:33:14): Amazon is cooked. By this time next year WMT will buy it out
Unknown User (2024-12-20 01:20:04): Agreed all amazon had to do was set bargaining dates with the union. They couldn't even be bothered to do that. What amazon Is doing is just flat out illegal, and harming their customers, On their path to stomping over their workers rights. 
Unknown User (2024-12-19 22:21:53): If people don’t get their orders before the holidays, they will lose trust in the company. They will surely be purchasing elsewhere next year and it doesn’t matter the reason for the delays. A company like this should have a plan in place if something like this happens. Not the workers fault
Unknown User (2024-12-19 22:21:33): i think so.  people deserve fair wage and lots of benefits.  pension etc.  
Unknown User (2024-12-19 22:19:26): Good timing for a strike lol
Unknown User (2024-12-19 21:23:37): So Im assuming Amazon closes those striking warehouses in 2025 and expands into non union labor markets.  Seem it done before successfully with other companies.  Short pain for long gain.  Whether you favor that approach or not it will drive the stock upward as a positive future catalyst if and when it happens.  
Unknown User (2024-12-19 21:06:55): Generating $60B in free cash flow this year highlights strong fundamentals. Still looks undervalued.

Unknown User (2024-12-19 15:15:42): Strike?
Unknown User (2024-12-19 14:14:17): It is all scripted 
Unknown User (2024-12-19 12:41:59): After the VIX spikes double digits it statistically has a big reversal day in the next 1-2, the odds are over 90%.  The problem is, Wall Street has positioned itself for inflation by shorting bonds and going long financials.  It should be positioned for recession - but Wall Street and the Fed doesn't believe recession is any where remotely close to happen (wrong).  I wouldn't touch a financial given the job data but Wall Street is aloof to the main street reality.  Wall Street is going to get its massive rate cuts, of course they will come after market devastation (deflation).  This would do the Fed a huge favor - as a recession would eliminate jobs and decimate demand, thus lowering inflation pressures.  But I'm just a random Yahoo message board poster - why would any one take me seriously.. haha Let's just say when reality comes to roost and it all unwinds... OH BOY - chase bounces at your own peril (use them to sell or hedge your positions).  
Unknown User (2024-12-19 21:54:12): It is going to be a Merry Christmas.

If you once doubted its value, remember that in 2010 it was just $0.40 and by March 2024, it hit $65K Why doubt it won't reach $108K7 For those interested in Bitcoin, now is the time to invest. I started early this year with the guidance, and her advice on crypto investment
Unknown User (2024-12-19 09:37:08): Hhahhahahahha, everybody in the world knew what the Fed was going to do today. It's been predicted for weeks that a .25 basis cut was coming. Rates higher for longer is the surprise, to some anyway. Stocks are not worth as much with higher rates for longer.
Unknown User (2024-12-19 07:50:48): All of them there all crooks nothing new!

Unknown User (2024-12-19 07:09:17): If the economy was really going to be that good then why doesn't hike rates? This is why the market went down. Powell isn't making sense.
Unknown User (2024-12-19 06:53:31): Yes, because if he tells you the truth the market would full on collapse, businesses would cut jobs, not invest in technology, liquidate inventory, etc.  Go look at his prior statements when the market was about to fall.  I am very long Amazon - but as I posted a week or so ago I was 100% hedged in my portfolio and advised others to consider the same so I have no ulterior motive in what I’m saying.  It’s just the truth - sorry.
Unknown User (2024-12-19 06:45:21): Powell after his press conference…”I feel very good about where the economy is,” he told reporters. “I expect another good year next year.”  
Unknown User (2024-12-19 04:57:22): Really.......
Unknown User (2024-12-19 05:32:54): It was 10% per day back then.

Unknown User (2024-12-19 04:41:15): Wait until the dollar explodes higher and destroys the global economy further.
Unknown User (2024-12-19 04:39:31): End of the year market correction. Expect the same next few days with minor recovery. Great buying opportunity for next year.
Unknown User (2024-12-19 04:36:11): Who- with any kind of brain- didn't know that the rate cuts would be ending soon?
Unknown User (2024-12-19 04:34:34): Think this hurts?  Wait until Wall Street accepts the factual data before it instead of media platitudes.
Unknown User (2024-12-19 04:33:50): With 30 minutes remaing before the final bell, I have a feeling the several posters who predicted a $236 close today will be slightly incorrect.

Unknown User (2024-12-19 05:12:07): Yeah, we certainly don't want anyone in this job that speaks the truth to the American people.
Unknown User (2024-12-19 04:17:50): Powell could simply keep adopting more hawkish rhetoric and cause the market to tank more in the coming days. I hope he takes a long vacation from his job.

Simple, Jeff stop trying to make workers to be a "Superman!"  Why not hire more people at the warehouse! 

Unknown User (2024-12-18 06:34:40): What is Amazon famous for?
Is it to create new software to brainwash any worker to be "Loyal, Push Hard, and Strive to the Top"? In other words, create a new software program to increase worker productivity, pushing workers beyond the limits of both physical and mental capabilities.
"Superman?" Right, Jeff? Jeff, you need to stop dreaming about creating workers to be Superman!

JRD (2024-12-17 20:49:08): MYNZ had 1:40 reverse split Nov 29th; that's never a good sign to invest. Who are these trolls?  
AI generated trolls?  
Unknown User (2024-12-17 18:35:44): Amazon’s AI investments are flying under the radar. 🧠 Between machine learning and robotics, they’re setting up for a huge future. Long and bullish here. Oh, and $MYNZ post-split play with strong institutional backing—one to keep an eye on for sure.💡
Unknown User (2024-12-17 18:32:16): $AMZN is one of those stocks where dips are gifts. AWS growth alone justifies the valuation. 📈 Watching how Prime’s new subscriptions boost Q4 too. Meanwhile, $MYNZ looks primed for action with that low 2M float post-split. Something’s cooking there. 🔍
Unknown User (2024-12-17 18:28:33): Amazon’s balance sheet is stacked—free cash flow just keeps growing. 💰 Add that to their Prime ecosystem and AWS dominance, and you’ve got an easy buy-and-hold play. Been watching $MYNZ too, just 2M float post-split. Nice setup for a squeeze.
Unknown User (2024-12-17 18:27:46): Bought AMZN under $150 earlier this year—patience pays. 🔑 Cloud demand is rising, and they’ve got Prime locked down globally. Still room for gains, folks. Low float plays are in right now too—$MYNZ worth a quick watch if you like tight setups.
Unknown User (2024-12-17 18:22:37): The AI race is heating up, and AMZN’s not playing games. AWS is leveraging machine learning to dominate. This stock is untouchable long-term. 📢 Side note: $MYNZ is looking interesting after the split. Just 2M float and solid backing. 🤫
Unknown User (2024-12-17 18:21:31): Earnings are gonna be 🔥. AWS is Amazon’s cash cow, and with AI pushing demand, this stock’s got room to fly. Volume looks strong. Keeping $MYNZ on my watchlist too—post-split float squeeze could hit soon. Stay sharp. 👀
Unknown User (2024-12-17 18:18:59): You can't possibly believe you are fooling anyone.
Unknown User (2024-12-17 18:18:05): $AMZN steady climb heading into the holidays, no surprise there. Cyber Monday numbers were insane, and AWS is firing on all cylinders. I see $300 as a clean target by mid-2025. Also, peep $MYNZ—low float and TMO partnership = sleeper play, in my opinion. 🚀
Unknown User (2024-12-17 18:16:33): AMZN is a monster 🦾. Solid fundamentals, AWS exploding, and Prime keeps crushing it. If you’re not holding this for the long term, you’re missing out.

Madilynn (2024-12-16 17:20:54): Patience has paid off holding AMZN. AWS and AI lead the way. Also, BOLT.CN and PCRCF are on my radar—showing strong promise.
Sawyer (2024-12-16 17:17:36): Massive cash flow and market dominance make AMZN a hold. By the way, BOLT.CN and PCRCF have solid potential—worth tracking.
Elena (2024-12-16 17:03:35): AMZN is more than e-commerce—cloud and AI are huge growth drivers. Meanwhile, $BOLT.CN and $PCRCF are looking sharp lately.
Maria (2024-12-16 16:51:55): $60B in free cash flow is unreal. AMZN’s cloud and logistics dominance continues. Watching $BOLT.CN and $PCRCF too—worth noting.
michael (2024-12-16 16:02:48): This makes no sense.  
Adam (2024-12-16 14:08:05): Amazon’s strong, but margins on Prime are getting squeezed. Looking elsewhere too—$BOLT.CN is one I’m watching closely. Early mover advantage in tech—huge potential here.
Eric (2024-12-16 14:03:20): Drones and satellites are cool, but AWS is Amazon’s bread and butter. That said, $PCRCF in Canada is worth tracking—quietly building a strong foundation in their sector. Might surprise people.
Aaron (2024-12-16 13:59:31): Strikes and rising costs? AMZN’s not as bulletproof as it used to be. Diversifying a bit, and $BOLT.CN has been catching my attention—massive potential in green tech if you’re patient.
Jason (2024-12-16 13:55:15): Amazon’s growth overseas is exciting, but don’t sleep on $PCRCF. They’re expanding smartly in their sector, and it feels like the market hasn’t caught on yet. Watchlist-worthy for sure.

Nathan (2024-12-16 13:49:43): Project Kuiper sounds cool, but does Amazon need this right now? Meanwhile, $BOLT.CN is quietly making moves in the clean tech space. Gotta keep tabs on them—could surprise.
michael (2024-12-16 16:03:26): This makes no sense.
Justin (2024-12-16 13:34:27): AMZN feels a bit pricey at these levels, tbh. Waiting for a dip to add more. In the meantime, $BOLT.CN is looking solid with their tech. Early-stage but promising—one to watch closely.

Looking at the market more broadly (SPX) -19% takes us back to 04/24, -33% takes us back to 10/23, -43% takes us back to 10/22, and -64% takes us back to 03/20.

If they can go up by that much, why can’t they go down by just as much?

Comment by britona at 2025-01-11 09:31:12+00:00:
I would think 20%-30% at worst. Maybe 50% in lengthy recession. You can protect yourself with a trailing stop loss order.

I still think there is room for growth with some of these stocks if inflation, interest rates and employment remain stable.

Comment by Professional_Gain361 at 2025-01-11 11:40:44+00:00:
The question is whether this time is different or this time is the same

if this time is different, then you might as well pick a number in random

if this time is no different, then you look at historic PE after pullback vs the current PE, and compute the differences.  The current PE is about 30 and historic PE is about 18-19.  

However, during the so called "crashes", like dotcom and financial crisis and Covid crashes, the prices tend to be over-corrected.  Pullbacks during those are at least 60% for SPX.  So it depends on whether you have a pullback like 2022 or a big crash.

Look for gaps in the chart. That's where they'll likely go in a correction.

Also look at the longer term charts. The Nasdaq made practically nothing 2000 - 2010.

Comment by RddtAcct707 at 2025-01-11 10:26:27+00:00:
In an aggressively bad situation, I’d take the current valuation and reduce it to a PE of 16.  Figure stocks won’t get a premium in that situation.

Also figure earnings would go down reducing the E part further but you need some wiggle room.

You..you don't think these companies can drop by how much they rose? You're looking at the survivor bias of companies that are successful right now. For every google or apple or nvidia right now there's a blackberry or nokia or other company that used to be big and folks didn't think would go down just for it to fold and now be a joke in investing forums. Don't anticipate a company's ability to screw up and take a nose dive. Don't underestimate the potential for certain sectors to be in bubbles. (Eg biotech had major gains during covid, now folks won't touch it. Ai is possibly a bubble, too.)

Comment by StockRegard at 2025-01-11 12:26:43+00:00:
The S&P 500 seems to only ever increase over the long term, exponential growth or something. From what I was seeing on all of the media including CNBC and financial institutions, a major crash like dotcom is basically impossible now (short of like a major catastrophe or world war I guess?). I guess if there was a really bad crash we would go back to the levels from 2 years ago or so but that would be a big correction.
----------------------------------------
Comment by sQueezy123 at 2025-01-11 11:53:30+00:00:
Could you explain? Lets say I own NVDA with an average of 110.. how would I go about doing this?
----------------------------------------
Comment by StockRegard at 2025-01-11 12:18:27+00:00:
All of the major financial institutions and CNBC said that a crash like the dotcom one is impossible because the magnificent seven, the big tech companies leading the S&P 500, are generating insane amounts of revenue at levels incomparable to back then. Basically they were saying that they are making so much money and the companies back then were not, basically they're saying it was a bubble with nothing to back it up, but the magnificent seven have their revenue to backup their valuations. So basically everybody is saying that kind of crash is impossible so at most it would be something like the pullback from 2022. The level of confidence seems incredibly high from everybody that a repeat of the dotcom is impossible - I guess there would need to be something catastrophic like world war. That's of course if the media and all of these financial institutions are correct in what they're saying, I would hope so because that's their job to analyze the stock market. I guess there is always a possibility they could be wrong but it seems unlikely.

If you're suggesting 100% of the appreciation of the index has been AI driven, you're wrong. It's been a significant driver, but not the only driver.

Comment by britona at 2025-01-11 18:39:33+00:00:
All you have to do is select your stock, click sell, all for number of shares, trailing stop loss, then select the dollar amount or % the stock needs to drop by before being sold and the time period for when the order is active.

Different brokerages use different formats to do this but there should be be tutorial within your brokerage on how to set it up.

Say NVDA closed yesterday at $140 and create a trailing stop loss order for $10. If the stock drops to $130, it will be sold. Now if the stock goes to $145 first, then comes down, it will get sold when it crosses $135 or below.

I'm a permabull, long term investor. I *still* think there will be at least one 40%+ correction in my life. Will it be exactly what happened in the dot-com crash? I doubt it. 

It's gonna be something nobody, or at least most people, don't expect or see coming. That's how it always goes.

Comment by StockRegard at 2025-01-11 13:17:34+00:00:
My understanding is that's why we are propping Intel up and other domestic chip manufacturing like the TSMC plant. I'm sure it would have a significant impact for some time but hopefully they can ramp up production domestically and in other regions that may be able to produce chips to help stabilize chip production and lessen the impact (like other TSMC plants in Europe and Asia).

Comment by jameshearttech at 2025-01-13 16:46:14+00:00:
I asked Copilot, "What advances have been made in machine learning and artificial intelligence since 2020?"

This was the response:  
Since 2020, there have been several significant advances in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI):

1. **Generative AI**: Tools like OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-4 have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP). These models can generate human-like text, translate languages, and even write code1. Their ability to understand and generate language has opened up new possibilities in various applications, from chatbots to automated content creation.
2. **Explainable AI (XAI)**: There has been a growing focus on making AI systems more transparent and understandable. XAI aims to make the decision-making processes of AI models more interpretable to humans, which is crucial for trust and accountability2.
3. **Ethical AI**: The ethical implications of AI have gained more attention. Efforts are being made to address biases in AI systems, ensure fairness, and develop guidelines for responsible AI use2.
4. **AI in Healthcare**: AI has made strides in precision medicine, diagnostics, and drug discovery. Machine learning models are being used to predict disease outbreaks, personalize treatment plans, and accelerate the development of new medications1.
5. **Edge AI**: The integration of AI in edge computing has become more prevalent. This allows AI models to run on devices like smartphones and IoT devices, reducing latency and improving real-time decision-making2.
6. **Reinforcement Learning**: Advances in reinforcement learning have led to improvements in robotics, gaming, and autonomous systems. These models learn by interacting with their environment, making them more adaptable and efficient2.

These advancements highlight the rapid progress in AI and ML, making these technologies more powerful and accessible across various domains. Is there a specific area of AI that interests you the most?

Based on this response why would any of these points be gone if the price of the S&P500 sold off to 2020 levels?
----------------------------------------
Comment by Enough_Leopard3524 at 2025-01-13 16:51:08+00:00:
I suspect your asking me questions you know the answer to, considering your using copilot. All the stock price action doesn’t matter, I guess is your point.  My point was if we were to reverse the outcome of all the catalysts that led us here we’d be in the same place we were in 2020. 

You’ve walked me into an epiphany… 🤨

For reference the S&P was up 58% in the same period (w/dividends reinvested), with near zero tax consequences.

I share your sentiment on $NVDA. I’m in tech, both as a founder of several businesses and investor. Almost every startup I see is doing something with AI and all the large mega-businesses are too. 

Granted there is some absolute non-sense happening with investments and startups, but AI is going to revolutionize everything we do. 

I’m in other non-AI investments but my AI strategy is to invest on the hardware side (NVDA, TSM, SOXL and even some AMD) and on the content side (RDDT). AI is driven by human content and Reddit is the greatest source of that right now.

If it takes off, I’ll get it from the index.  Less risky that way.  I made a 40% return on single stocks then diversified because the odds were not on my side that I could keep it up.

Would you mind sharing how you got +845% if you acquired in 2022 and sold in 2023? Looking at the performance, CVNA was high but on its was down in 2022, and did not recover significantly until 2024.

Taking on additional risk can amplify returns in a bull market and losses in a bear market.  Getting higher returns is impressive, unless it's done via outsized risk.  Do you quantify risk in your portfolio?  How do you assess your risk?

Comment by Areign at 2024-12-17 14:05:30+00:00:
just for comparison, S&P 500 on June 1 2022 was 3899 and today its 6063.79 so that's 

6063.79/3899^(1/[2+6.5/12])=1.19 which means an annualized 19% ROI over the same period. So like 1/3 of the OP

edit: oh didn't see the end of your post, weird that your number for S&P ROI is so much higher though

The answer to that question is overdetermined and IMO easier to answer the other way. The 'ChatGPT moment' when AI entered the public consciousness and investment meaningfully increased was \~2 years ago.

Given past technological advancements, do we think we're near the end of what possible after two years or the beginning?

That's where I'd start. Working in the industry, talking to folks and watching what others are building reinforces this. For example, just about every scientist and research I've talking to is excited because we're just scratching the surface of what's possible.

For consumer examples, look at the videos Sora is creating (I recently got access to it). It has a long way to go, but I can imagine the possibilities. For example, imagine coming home and wanting to watch a new sequel of <your favorite franchise here>, but on a different timeline/scenario and just asking AI to generate it. How much would you pay for that? What about for a custom, fully immersive VR video game?

And that's just the world of bits. Move to the world of atoms and imagine robots trained to fix/build anything and do anything around the home, to train you how to improve your swing, etc. What if you could learn anything with a dedicated tutor? That's all possible with AI. How much economic value is that in the US and around the world?

I use it multiple times a day, every day. It's great, but still has a lot to improve on even in the scope of daily life. But as it becomes better, faster and cheaper it'll increase by orders of magnitude in usefulness.

Well we don't have: 

* Ambient Intelligence (AI in the Air)
* AI-Powered Molecular Fabrication (AI for Instant Objects)
* AI-Driven Health Guardians
* AI-Enhanced Education
* Biological Integration (AI in our Bodies)

Machine Learning & AI as it exists today is an infant. It is way too rough around the edges to use in real big business, in high leverage situations, especially with regulations in place.

The acceleration of AI is just beginning, and the pace is off the charts. It may appear as though it has slowed down, but that’s because the next area of focus is adding reasoning to LLMs and robotics.

I think we will see a breakthrough in Tesla for full self-driving cars where you can just sleep to your next destination. That’s a big deal and would change everything once that’s widespread. AI robots in the workplace will also become a reality soon. And can you imagine what quantum computing will do for all of this? 

Companies would not be pouring BILLIONS into AI if they didn’t expect a return on their investment. We *always* hit limits on technology and slow down… and then we break through.

>What made you want to sell some of your big winners?

Things felt overvalued after the post-election rally. Nvidia and Meta had the most attractive valuations relative to their market positions (especially if there's a correction) as well as the most long-term upside, so I held them.

Plus feeling they were overvalued was just nagging in the back of my mind, so pulling the trigger to sell them also freed up some mental cycles, which is valuable in itself.

I still believe in most of those companies (especially Tesla, Palantir, etc.) but the relative valuation just felt high.

I'll certainly miss some short-term upside, but I'm hoping to make up for it long-term.

>What do you think of Reddit stock right now?

Sorry, I don't have an opinion on it since it's not in my area of expertise. I've learned (the hard way) to only invest in what I know deeply, thus where I have an advantage.
----------------------------------------
Comment by gabe736 at 2024-12-16 23:49:48+00:00:
Yeah, I have questions there too. Amazon for example now has their Trainum 2 chips in GA promising better price performance, whith Trainium 3 chips coming next summer. This will cut into Nvidia's market share at the low end, as AWS' goal is always to commoditize infra. Google also has its own TPUs it uses.

But they and all other hyperscalers still use Nvidia's GPUs as well due to the unmatched versatility and ecosystem. Where the balance settles is still a big question.

The more negative case for Nvidia is if somehow we reach the limits GPU scaling on all fronts (e.g. even o1's economics don't scale, which is unlikely), in which case GPUs become more commoditized to the extent that the other aspects of their moat (CUDA, ecosystem, networking, etc.) can't make up for it.

However, I don't think that is the case. I'm also curious how large sovereign AI becomes in the coming years.

Long-term I'd expect Nvidia's market share to settle around \~70% (from \~90% today for datacenter AI GPUs). But even if competitors catch up and it drops to 50% I believe the market will be massive enough to achieve attractive returns.

I agree. I still feel like we've yet to deep though and there may well be a short-term bust as the superficial ones wash out.

But building applications myself, talking to scientists, etc. it's incredible just how many more ways there  are to use it that'll be immensely beneficial. It'll just take time since the world also has to reconfigure around these things, just how the world reconfigured for roads and automobiles, electricity, the internet, etc.

What gives me hope is the awareness around AI since the public and government seem increasingly excited about it, which seems to be overcoming the initial fear -- at least to the extent the government understands it can't outlaw it and much embrace it to be competitive.

I had to look it up. Bought CVNA 12/14/2022 and sold 9/11/2023.

I hadn't looked at it since I sold, but looking now I missed out on a **ton** of upside. However, I was focused on the short-term recovery, not the longer term business prospects since that business isn't my wheelhouse and I had more conviction in AI, so reallocated into Nvidia. You win some you lose some I guess.

I've been reading Stratechery, a tech/business analyst for almost a decade, which I credit for building my understanding of the industry. He has really strong analysis that helped me see through the market noise (voting machine vs. weighing machine) and make clear headed investment decisions on those.

My biggest regret is not following through on buying Nvidia in late 2022 at its bottom before the AI boom after he [analyzed its prospects](https://stratechery.com/2022/nvidia-in-the-valley/). This is after I had already went all-in on the pandemic stocks, thus didn't have a lot of extra cash at the time. About a year later is when I started selling the pandemic stocks to buy Nvidia and other AI stocks.

What I love most about his analysis is that he's not a stock picker, which keeps his analysis clear and unbiased. He just analyses the companies in the context of the industry and gives his analysis. He has a genuine love for the industry and analysis, which makes ability unmatched.

Not for me. Stratechery had a great summary on it. A quote from his article [TSMC Earnings, Margins and Arizona, ASML and Peak Lithography](https://stratechery.com/2024/tsmc-earnings-margins-and-arizona-asml-and-peak-lithography/):

>That leaves TSMC and its upcoming investment at 2nm and 16A, which is a challenge for ASML for three reasons. First, there is the aforementioned shift in TSMC’s model; repurposing equipment likely means fewer lithography orders. Second, while ASML may have a monopoly on advanced lithography, TSMC is poised to have monopsony power in terms of being able to actually make money on processes that utilize ASML’s advanced lithography, which may depress prices (this is the third factor that could help TSMC’s margins). The third challenge is that we are past peak lithography.

From Doug O’Laughlin at [Fabricated Knowledge](https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/earnings-tsmc-asml-aehr-telecom):

>Another way to interrupt this statement is that EUV intensity is peaked if they think the DUV attach rate is growing as fast as EUV. This has been a long time coming, and Applied Materials puts it well in this slide – 3nm is the apex of lithography market share gains. This is not good for ASML and the EUV story.

>...

>The last decade has been the decade of Lithography, and I can almost assure you that Lithography spending will grow slower in the next decade than WFE \[Wafer Fab Equipment\]. And let’s not forget that in the decade before EUV, lithography was only 15-20% of the expenditure. I believe that lithography will revert to the mid-20s of WFE.

>I think it’s time for investors to accept the decade of lithography is over. The premium ASML has slowly gained for itself for the last decade should end as the decade of litho ends. And the recent price move has been a collapse of that premium. I believe it should trade in line with other semi-cap companies, as I’m sure that Litho will not outgrow WFE but will be valued for its strong monopoly.

It's still continue to be a good business, but not a great one that is likely to produce outsized returns.

I think the two big questions are 1) does Intel even have a future and 2) why would anyone buy from Intel?

I don't mean that in a snarky way, but I have legitimate concerns about their future. And those concerns would make would-be chip buyers less likely to invest in chips from them.

Assuming Intel does come out strong, I'm curious how attractive their chips would be compared to 1) hyperscalers like Amazon making their own chips and 2) alternatives like AMD for everyone else.

In terms of desirability, how I see it playing out is those who prioritize training would want the most powerful GPUs for training, then rotate those to inference as they get replaced by better GPUs.

As long as Nvidia is supply constrained, there will be room for competitors. And there will increasingly be demand for more efficient, low powered inference.

So IMO the first question is whether Intel remains viable. Then if they do, how attractive are they to everyone who isn't building their own chips and for what purpose -- as a designer? A fab?

As long as their current board is in place, I don't see much changing for them since in terms of expertise Pat Gelsinger was the best shot they had.

The sad thing about this is if you look at most of the historical innovation in terms of processes, Intel led the way there and TSMC followed. So if Intel dies, I don't know who will pick up the torch. Intel was quite amazing, just a tragedy how they fell.

Comment by gabe736 at 2024-12-18 22:34:53+00:00:
Not likely. Nvidia has >80% market share and nobody else is even close. Betting on anyone else would be diluting returns IMO.

However I’m looking and fundamentals and qualitative factors. The market is often based on other speculative factors, judging by the valuations of others so I’m not saying it won’t happen short term, just that I wouldn’t bet on it based on what I see.

>You could have achieved a similar return by levering a diversified index

Interesting. Which index achieved a \~70% annual rate of return during that period?

>Ride out a down market with those same stocks and let us know if you’re still outperforming.

Why? My goal is to buy low and sell high. I intentionally bought them at the bottom of the down market. Why would I buy stocks and ride out a down market?

I covered it in a previous update, but prior to the pandemic dip I was largely in cash beginning in late 2021 anticipating a drop. I did the same thing with the '08/'09 recession (in my 20's), though I was more heavily in depressed real estate in addition to stocks.

I go where the opportunities are and that's why I'm all in on AI now. I don't consider it gabling though, I have generally have deep knowledge about what I invest in (in addition to a MS in Finance and an MBA).

Will I always be right? No, but I share transparent updates here and enjoy the feedback and interaction. BTW I really would love to here about the index you're referring to with the \~70% annual return you mentioned.
----------------------------------------
Comment by gabe736 at 2024-12-20 15:48:30+00:00:
In late 2021 there were rumblings of billionaire unloading assets, fed policy shifts and increasing inflation. Plus it just felt generally unsustainable since it wasn't clear anything sustainable was driving it. I also listen to a lot of VCs and other investors, who felt the same thing, but stayed in because they were still making money.

Timing the market is hard and I generally don't do it. Even in this case I didn't time it all that well:

1. I was first in indexes, then in cash before the drop so I definitely missed out on some upside.
2. It was 7 months of ups and down (mostly down) until I was consistently in the green. I'd be lying if I said I didn't question my decisions during that time, but I kept buying more companies as they bottomed out if they had good fundamentals (with a few exceptions, which were a mixed back, but up overall).

I think the hardest part of investing is understanding your own psychology enough to have the right discipline. If you can do that, then it's easier to take in a lot of data sources, ignore the noise (see most comments here and talking heads on TV), and make your own decisions.

It also helps that I learned lessons and built discipline, patience and instincts during the last recession. With this one I didn't invest more than I could afford to lose. And as my returns grew, I could invest more since I was just risking my returns.

Lastly, I also knew I was investing for the long-term, which allowed me to be patient and not worry about short-term movements. I still watch the market every day out of interest, but don't trade all that much because long-term trends changes and meaningful new information don't happen that often.

Lastly, the only way to outperform the market is to be contrarian and right. So by definition, you have to ignore what most people are saying, but also have enough judgement to know if you're informed enough to do that. There's also no doubt luck plays a big factor in many aspects.

I can't mentally put myself there from an investment perspective, also from a conviction perspective since I've been building my knowledge in tech for over a decade.

That said, Nvidia is still my highest conviction investment since they have no real competitors, \~80% market share and numerous other advantages while driving potentially the largest secular trend we've ever seen (which we're just at the beginning of).

But just a reminder, doing well in investing isn't just about knowing what stock to buy when. It's also about having a deep enough knowledge in what you're investing in so you know the difference between having the conviction to hold weathering a downturn and the wisdom to sell when it's the right time. IMO that's the hard part...the day in day out wondering if you're making the right decisions, especially on the bad days/weeks/months.

I work at the #1 cloud provider in the AI industry with leading AI research firms and I think we are hitting the limits of the transformer architecture. New model benchmarks (e.g., Amazon Nova) are providing marginal improvements at best while pre-training and fine tuning costs remain very high (multiple millions for just fine-tuning). The underlying technical limitation of the architecture will limit the apps built on top (video gen, autonomous agents, etc.). If all the economy gets for this investment are copilots and customer service chatbots, then that is valuable but not a game-changer.

I can't tell you how awful this sounds. The end of endings is a change in thinking I'm not sure people are ready for or need.


Like, the MCU multiverse arc is garbage. If anything is possible, nothing matters. Character is dead? They're alive again with zero effort. I am checked out of that series because there is no emotional investment. Why would I bother to watch something that has no ending? I am watching it to find out _how it ends_. I want satisfaction. Or dissatisfaction. Some finality. 


I guess it kind of works for soap operas? But like, you watch those to discuss them, to at least see some storylines end. And who wants to talk about what your individual machine hallucinated for you? Will anyone else care?

Taxes were relatively small, particularly because most of my sales qualified for long-term capital gains.

Maybe I misunderstand what you mean by 'relatively minimal additional benefit'. An annualized return of over 70% is 3X-5X what indexes like S&P 500 and Nasdaq earned during that same period.

ive done ok with momentum plays. Covid recovery and Ai. From nothing to something which is great but Ai seems to be topping out and stalling so not sure what to do now. Might just put it into QQQ and wait for the next opening. I also only trade within an ISA so dont have so many options.

What is the underlying technical limitations? I don’t think anyone really knows how any of this works.  You could describe in terms matrix algebra/calculus description but that doesn’t really explain why it works. A new architecture or breakthrough will come along that speeds development, training, something else who knows, it consistently has.  It was the transformer with RLHF that had the biggest impact I thought. In ~5 years students may be training ChatGPT 4 level agents for college projects.  There will be a company that wraps a sora like model with another deep learning algorithm that optimizes videos pixel by pixel to grab users attention as strongly as possible.

AWS I assume? Still bigger than GCP and Azure I think, though I believe Azure might be seeing more AI demand due to OpenAI? Either way, you have an incredible vantage point on the industry.

This might be true, but o1 has shown us new opportunities for scaling. We still may also see improvements to pre-training with more scale, synthetic data, etc. but I'm not holding my breath for that. However, I do expect improvements with efficiency and optimization of models. Suffice to say that scaling compute isn't the only way to improve.

I'm also excited because I believe we've barely scratched the surface of where we can even implement the current state of AI into the existing economy. E.g. let's assume AI models don't improve at all, there's still 5+ years of progress we could make by efficiently implementing what we have today --  especially as more people get better at understanding how to use it. Though this would shift the focus to inference from training and have implications, but I'm still optimistic.

In a nutshell given that AI is effectively intelligence, my core assumption is that we're more likely to underestimate the impact than overestimate it -- especially given Nvidia's still reasonable P/E ratio (51 as of right now) with supply constraints.

We shall see. I'll continue to share periodic updates on the bets I've made.

If you truly believe that the transformer is only to be applied to customer service chatbots and coding copilots then you sincerely lack imagination.

Look at Waymo, look at Tesla, look at Recursion Pharmaceuticals, look at Palantir, look at BigBear, look at RedCat. There are hundreds of examples of *current* explorations of AI beyond just being a chatbot.

This is just the beginning. The real boon here will be the spilling over of AI into other domains and those unrealized gains are undetermined and difficult to predict, but it’s already begun and I expect it to continue. Very few people beyond research scientists give a shit about the benchmarks everyone harps over. The most important part IMO is how will AI be applied in non-technological domains.

Not OP, but with a good baseline prompt, including telling it to ask clarifying and continuing questions to keep a back-and-forth going, it can be useful to essentially “think out loud” on some problems or ideas that you don’t have fully fleshed out but hit mental road blocks on, or need to find vocabulary for something you might not have. But I as well don’t use it nearly every day, more like a couple times a month.

I most often use it in place of Google for asking questions, looking things up, research, etc. I also take screenshots of things and ask for analysis. A random use case: I'm color blind, so I'll take a picture of clothes and ask if they match -- before buying clothes, matching clothes to wear, etc.

At my startup I'm the CEO and mostly do product, so I don't code much, but I have used it for code.

I also use it for translations (e.g. when doing customer support for non-english speakers).

Our startup uses it as part of our core technology, but we still have a long ways to go -- and so does AI in terms of quality, speed and cost, to be more useful.

I also use it with my kids when they occasionally ask things I don't know when we're driving.

For me it's insane how useful it is and I'd easily pay 10X what I pay for it now ($20/mo) for the same capabilities.

I've never used it to reply to an email.

Some people like MCU, others like Duck Dynasty, others like the Housewives reality shows, others like documentaries, others love anything from Disney and Pixar, etc.

I love movies, but rarely discuss them with anyone as it seems you do, so that won't matter for me. And if I could, I'd be watching Sicario sequel #103 tonight, or maybe Iron Man #17 or John Wick #347 because I love the characters and that those kinds of films. Even better, instead of generating a movie to watch, I'd want to 'play' the storyline in a dynamically AI generated VR world, which is even a few steps behind full-length movies.

The point isn't really about what **you** like specifically, but rather anyone can have whatever they like, no matter what it is because the cost of creating it will be near zero -- just whatever compute cycles it takes to generate combined with whatever IP you decide to use (license), whether you want t own or rent it, share it with others (to maybe make a few bucks), etc.

Not everyone will want to create and that's fine, but those who do now can. Just like ever improving smartphone cameras made more people take pictures, how Garage Band, etc. helped more people make music, and how WordPress. made more people bloggers/amateur journalists/writers, etc. It's about democratization, and technology moves every upwards towards higher levels of abstraction. And you can choose to consume what they make or not.

Today the constraint is that tremendous investment has to be made in one thing from one director. But tomorrow, everyone can be a director. Yes, the average quality will go down, but it doesn't matter. It only matters that 1) it's possible and 2) some people will want it.

>What signal will change your mind on Nvda and Meta?

I doubt it'd be a specific signal since I developed conviction over a long period of time from many signals. But some examples of things that'd change my mind about the future (and would prompt an underwear change 💩😆):

* **Nvidia:** They are no longer supply constrained, particularly if it's due to something pointing to permanently reduced demand like significantly limited returns from GPU scaling.
* **Meta:** They stop seeing returns from implementing AI in ads and see an extended period of reduced or stagnant impression growth resulting in increasingly higher ad prices (counterintuitive, but points to limited future opportunities). Another one might be Apple launching a new wearable that's comparable to Meta's Orion, which points to Apple owning the next platform paradigm, like they did with the iPhone. Another might be some regulation around AI that outlaws their Llama model.

It could be a number of things, but more broadly anything that meaningfully points to AI not being the meaningful trend I think it is. That's not to say there won't be bubbles, busts or that Nvidia/Meta won't have meaningful short-term corrections, but that happens -- I've been investing long enough to be comfortable with those.

>What are you buying today?

Today I actually bought a small amount of SMCI again since they dropped due to the Nasdaq delisting and are still depressed from issues due to their reporting.

But it’s risky since things still seem fishy and it’s more akin to gambling than I’m typically comfortable with, so I only purchased small amount.

I decided to take a chance since their sales still seem strong, but doubt I’ll hold it long term since it’s not a high conviction bet for me, I'm just playing the short-term volatility after watching it for months.

I don't have any plans to buy anything else, but I rarely do. I mostly just trade based on whenever I get new information or valuations change enough to buy/sell, which is unpredictable. I generally don't trade very often, so buying SMCI to hold short-term is unusual for me.

Yes, but just about every major company is AI forward thinking right now. I haven't followed reddit's business for a long time, thus don't know it well.

Meta on the other hand I watched for a long time, including the bust following ATT (when I bought) through their reemergence as an I leader.

A lot goes into it, but I just don't invest in business I don't know well and I don't know reddit well. There's also not enough history as a public company to learn about it yet.

In this portfolio, yes for now. I’ll miss out on some upside, but things felt frothy so I wanted to capitalize on the post-election bump. META and NVDA seemed to have the most reasonable valuation given earnings growth x moats.

Today I bought a small amount of SMCI on the Nasdaq delisting news since they are depressed, but not a long-term thing, just holding until they recover a bit. More just having fun than anything since holding 2 stocks is a bit boring 😆

But I expect to buy others once I feel things are more reasonable.

No, I'm specifically asking more about how you achieved a \~70% annual rate of return like I did with your index during that period. Show me as I've shown you.

I share these transparent updates for feedback, to learn and get better. But to value your criticism, I have to know if it's legit or no different than the other negative comments here 💩 That's why I want to know how you did it.

An observation: You seem to imply that I don't follow investing best practices or what most professional investors do. **And you're right.**

But if I did I'd have nothing interesting to share because alpha comes from being contrarian and right. And when I build strong conviction on something, I go all in as I've shown (I did the same in the last recession).

When I don't have strong conviction (which is most of the time), I'm in an index to at least match the market. If I shared these updates while in an index or in cash (as I was before these updates started in 2022), they wouldn't be worth sharing.

> given that AI is effectively intelligence

This seems like a strange viewpoint for someone in the industry as opposed to, well, marketing. What we're calling AI now is nothing more than autocomplete. A very powerful form of it, sure, but there's no intelligence there.

I do firmly believe that GPT-3 and ChatGPT were essentially both the beginning and the end of what's possible. If only because we're firmly running out of new suitable training data. Right now, we're all just waiting out the clock to see when the capital figures this out.

Staying with Nvidia is clever, though. They're profitable while the companies using their hardware are operating at a loss with no realistic path to profitability. They don't need AI to work, they just need people to think it will. I'd be concerned about Nvidia's pivot, though.

So far, the industry has managed to keep specialized GPUs relevant ever since that first started for hashing / blockchain mining. But if AI becomes less relevant and there's nothing to fill the gap, I'd be concerned whether Nvidia can retain its position next to AMD for more general purpose hardware.

People like to be cynical. Nothing ever happens!

Sora is bigger than video generation. LLMs gain an understanding of the semantic space through prediction, within which is encoded true and useful relationships.

eg X "To get eggs I went to the _blank_" Is semantically similar to Y "You can get eggs at the store", so an LLM that had Y in the training set can generalize to things like X.

Well Sora and other video prediction tools gain an understanding of the video space, which encodes physically useful relationships. If you go watch Sora, you'll see it understands some things, like lighting and shadows some physical processes, but then not others... Yet. Just like you can generate an agent from a powerful LLM, you will soon be able to do the same with video gen, but it will actually have a physical understanding of the world. 

We would then be ~2/3 of the way to a fully autonomous talking humanoid robot. The other third being integrating these 2 + physical control mechanism into one model.

I can't guarantee AI won't go down, but you can be sure it will go higher than it is now within the decade, barring bad black swan events.

Transformer architecture has been a thing since 2017. Some of the examples you give are in fact big data rebranded as AI.


This whole bubble is based on the _perception_ that AI is "thinking" because it mimics human speech pretty well. Behind the scenes, it's based on things discovered years ago and scaled up. And we're at the end of the scaling up part.


It's going to work 97% of the time but the last 3% is so critical that it can never be trusted to do a whole critical job, and once companies start charging enough to break even on their products the value may not be there.

GenAI is still garbage for any true SME material where accuracy matters. Garbage in, garbage out. The worst part is the people most tempted to use it or the ones who are typically least likely to catch the nuanced errors that are still pervasive.

It's nice for generating code, but we've actually banned it on any client related deliverable work at my consulting firm because the hallucinations are as bad as ever. Doesn't help that they've run out of public internet content to feed these models so now they are feeding them AI-generated content to learn, which is just ass backwards AF. I recall reading that chatgpt-5 is based on like 40% AI-generated synthetic content lol...and the accuracy is barely any better than 4.

I don't find tools that spit out routinely questionable content to be that useful personally. And I'm not alone, industry is still struggling to actually monetize these features and customers continue to not be impressed. Hell even isheep don't believe in it...

I work in one of this top giants with LLMs for the past few years. The predictive text argument is correct and wrong at the same time. There’s more juice to it than it may seem.

LLMs do learn to recognise and apply patterns and it’s what they do exclusively and by design, all correct. But a solution process is a pattern too. For example, when you see 11x12=? you either know the answer because you learned the pattern before or apply a step-by-step process to get to it. Both are patterns and LLMs can do both.

LLMs have been trained mostly with the first type of pattern because it’s the most available kind of data. RLHF has oppened the door to process-type patterns. but the data is much harder and expensive to curate. The introduction of agents will make it way easier to record processes and their outcomes, accelerating the improvement cycle.

That’s on the research side. On the market side there are tens of thousands of companies that will soon see a real value on moving to the cloud and have their piles of static data become actually usable. It is already STARTING to change every single industry

I'd be concerned about this too, but I fundamentally disagree. For example:

>What we're calling AI now is nothing more than autocomplete. A very powerful form of it, sure, but there's no intelligence there.

You could call it that, but human cognition also relies on recognizing patterns and applying them recursively. AI is different in that it does the same with language without understanding it, but it's pattern matching nonetheless -- not so different than humans.

>I do firmly believe that GPT-3 and ChatGPT were essentially both the beginning and the end of what's possible. If only because we're firmly running out of new suitable training data.

GPT 3.5 and 4 with significant improvements beyond 3, making new things possible. I experienced this directly as when they came out I was at a public company building their first AI products. "ChatGPT" is just a chatbot interface and the first application of AI that really brought it into public awareness, which is why it's immensely important. But the chatbot UI is just the beginning. It's kind of like how with the internet everything was 'internet enabled' and with mobile there was a mobile version of every website (remember the .mobi extension?), etc. But now the internet is just part of everything. The same will happen to AI.

I use AI multiple times a day and have built multiple products with it than generate strong revenues (people pay for it because they find it useful). Maybe you have different experiences. I don't expect to change your mind here, but I guess we'll see what happens.

I think AI does what humans can do in those spaces being discussed here but without the efficiency/cost reduction of "intuition." That is, humans work more like quantum computers, meaning that current AI, limited by the traditional hardware paradigm, can do the same thing but requires much more cost.

I agree, and people said the same thing about the internet and electricity, e.g. when they just swapped steam engines for electric motors without redesigning factory workflows. They're called disruptive technologies for a reason.

I also saw the same thing at the public company I left a year ago trying to implement AI, so I 100% agree with you. Don't you remember last year when every public CEO was scrambling to come up with an 'AI strategy'? Of course most of them are garbage. Even outside of AI, how often do even basic refactors at large organizations end well? 😆

But there's a reason the opposite is true at newer companies standing up AI in new functions because when you start from zero you don't have to wrestle with the legacy assumptions and stacks (think building a new house vs. renovating an old one).

This is true for every new technology. In fact, has there ever been a groundbreaking new technology that just 'slid right in' to the existing paradigm without a hitch?

One way to help see around this is asking:

* Can the new technology do a meaningful number of things in a new and better way?
* Is it expected to continue to get better, cheaper and faster?
* Do we expect the advantages to outweigh the disruption, friction and growing pains of implementing it?
* Will companies who successfully implement the technology have a meaningful competitive advantage over those who don't?

Maybe you really believe the answer to those questions is no, and that's fine. But I believe the answer is yes with strong conviction.

It’s less about ‘religion’ and more about observation. Anyone paying attention can see the transformative impact AI already has across industries — from automating complex tasks to accelerating research and innovation. Calling it ‘religion’ dismisses the very real, tangible changes happening today.

Just strong short term conviction about the recovery, particularly since they are one of Nvidia's key partners, which is driving their strong revenue growth. So it really ties back to strong conviction in Nvidia.

> Both are patterns and LLMs can do both.

…no? It's a large *language* model. It doesn't know the meaning of 11 or 12. There is no way for it to understand in a general way that multiplying by 12 is one more than multiplying by 11. Sure, you can train it on lots of calculations and keep fine-tuning it until it gets most of them right. But what you're doing then is taking computers (which are really good at computing) and making them compute like a human (which are not). I… fail to see the benefit of this.

> It is already STARTING to change every single industry

I never denied this. I'm just pretty sure it's also *finishing*. The fact that a change happened is no guarantee that it will continue happening.

Comment by arienh4 at 2024-12-17 15:48:57+00:00:
> AI is different in that it does the same with language without understanding it, but it's pattern matching nonetheless 

No it isn't. It's just statistically deciding the likelihood of one token following a sequence of tokens. That is all. There is absolutely nothing else going on than just that. The more tokens you can fit in your context and the more data you throw into your model, the more comprehensible the output becomes, yes. But that's still not pattern matching, it's just predictive text.

>  making new things possible

Like what? I still remember hearing the same arguments about Bitcoin. It was also going to be part of everything. That didn't exactly pan out.

> and have built multiple products with it than generate strong revenues

Did you train your own models? Do you run inference on your own hardware? If the answer to either or both of those questions is 'no', then your strong revenues depend on other companies operating at a loss to provide these things for you. How sustainable do you think that is?

Comment by Osanj23 at 2024-12-17 17:09:30+00:00:
Waymo is also different in the way the problem is approached IMO. They started with a "simple version of the problem" (Phoenix with flat grid-like layout), they geofence the autonomous area, there are operation centers (which I think will never go away) that monitor and can intervene remotely if required. It's rather unemotional and more pragmatic in the sense that they don't just seem to assume that the problem can be solved automagically in all its forms and variations, but providing the autonomous ride service is priority #1 and not general self-driving.

They can scale up the business city by city and capture the parts of the market that bring a lot of $$$ (vast urban areas with simple traffic environment), learn and fix/constraint the product, so it becomes viable and as efficient as possible without having the ambition/pressure to solve it for the entire (ever-changing) global system of roads all at once.

Yeah, no worries. You should expect to get your balls busted after making a brag post about how much money you made on NVDA and Meta (not exactly sleeper picks there) with your reasoning being AI, trust me. Lots of us went heavy AI and made life changing money these past few years. Question is whether it will keep rolling or slow down in the mid term. Your posts so far don't inspire me that you've got much of an edge looking forward. But what do I know?

Comment by gabe736 at 2024-12-17 17:18:55+00:00:
Yep, that's a good point. Given it seems every Tesla is collecting data and Elon is building ever bigger clusters, maybe they'll break through with the AI getting good enough to allow fully autonomous driving like Waymo in some areas.

If that actually happens it seems they'd be hard to catch up with given the immense data advantage. But then again, there are other meaningful economic dynamics to make things really work. Like will people want their cars to be used as Robotaxis? If not, will Tesla really want that capital expense? Will there be Tesla 'roadlords' who own a stable of cars to get rented out? Will the layouts of cities change when car ownership drops, therefore reducing the need to even use cars on a daily basis long-term?

Exciting times.

I'm looking at the December 20 options and there was no froth yesterday morning but the froth has returned so a lot of open interest at $250 - $255 today. I sold $250 covered calls for $1.85 yesterday and will be fine with getting called out.

I actually love Apple's M4 launch and they will continue to roll out devices in Q1 and Q2. The only thing that I'm worried about is the iPhone. 

I like Amazon as well because Apple is using Amazon's AI chips for their AI endeavors. I am not currently long AMZN but I do like them.

Warren Buffett sold a lot of his Apple stock though he said it was more for tax purposes. He's sitting on a huge cash pile.

There are absolutely good reasons to book profits or use a hedging strategy.

Title: Are any Mag 7 Stocks worth buying right now for long term, if not which are worth waiting for in 2025?
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hp84q6/are_any_mag_7_stocks_worth_buying_right_now_for/
Comment by wes70lan at 2024-12-29 23:37:39+00:00:
Alright, since some people like to be an asshole instead of answering like a normal human being, here’s my answer based on my personal experience. Buying at an all-time high raises eyebrows for some, but if you’re investing in a company with strong fundamentals, who cares? I don’t worry about MSFT’s price, I invest monthly regardless. There’s a well-known quote: “I don’t buy stocks, I buy companies.” Personally, I’m focused on accumulating shares and adding more to the companies and ETFs I believe in. More shares, bigger returns in the long run. If MSFT drops 20%, that’s a 20% discount on future financial freedom.

Now, if you’re out there chasing hot stocks at an all-time high because of FOMO, well, that’s on you. But if the company is solid, don’t sweat it. Prices fluctuate, sure, but eventually, they tend to climb back and hit new highs.

For those still uncertain, stop banging your head against the wall and stick to ETFs. Companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are solid, wide-moat businesses. Unless some major negative news breaks, there’s no reason to panic about the price.

That said, I’d be cautious with Tesla. It’s a volatile stock, highly sensitive to news, and that unpredictability can lead to some headaches.

***Everyone wants to be a long term investor until the market tests their conviction.***

Probably 6 of the 7 would be the way to hedge your question. AAPL now has a higher value than the entire market in Germany. Microsoft? If you had put $1000 into it at IPO and held, it would be worth 5.7 million. The other 4 have huge moats.

They are all worth buying for the long term. Buy now and in 5 years you will do well even if they go up or down in the short term. Bought AAPL 5 years ago and never looked back. Volatility happens in the short term but muted in the long term if the company is profitable and does buyback. Compounding is on your side.

All are fine to buy or at worst hold imo, except TSLA which is volatile af and due for a big correction after recent rallies, always happens like clockwork.

Especially GOOG imo, only one that isnt that frothy in terms of valuation while still having the same quality of business, growth and innovation.

Your over thinking things. Choose an investment product that aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Can you stomach a 20+% drop or buy more of the stock in this situation (assuming you are still bullish on the outlook of the company and their financials).


It's fine to pick "boring" investments. The goal is to make money. If that means picking a US heavy etf, global exposure etf or stock picking, then do so with your investment style and experience in mind. 


Personally, almost all of the MAG 7 I would buy at current prices. This has more to do with my outlook for these stocks rather than their current stock price.

It depends on your risk profile. If you want super low risk go for something like bonds or steady indexes. If you want more risk then invest in specific stocks. If you want to be super risky then put your life savings into one volatile stock.. it could go up a load but you could lose like 20%+ in a day. It depends on your overall portfolio and how much you're willing to risk. No one can really tell you if something is going up or down with 100% certainty. If you're doing long term investing then diversify your portfolio with a mix of different risk category assets so like 70% index and 30% spread across a few choice stocks.

How are bitcoin and tesla unethical? Tesla is on the cusp of solving FSD which could save millions of lives from car accidents in the very near future. Bitcoin is promising as a hedge against the disgusting amount of currency debasement we’ve endured since 2020.

I'm a 9-5 worker looking to invest for the long term. A market correction or a "bubble" is the least of my worries. Hence i build up my cash position as well for these opportunities. When Apple reaches $300 people will say i should have invested at $200

When Apple drops to $100 people will think it is too risky.

If you want to buy at a certain specific price, have at it. I have my account set to do it automatically each month. I can't argue with people that have different strategies because more than likely there won't be any agreement

Price goes up, price goes down and market has some drawbacks. Market goes back to reach all time highs. We have been listening to the same song for more than we've even been alive. It is the same thing every time. If it takes one year, three, five, ten years, it doesn't matter. Market will always move. That is why i automate and have my ETFs to lead my portfolio.

Why make it hard, when you can make it easy, slow but surely?


Everyone claims to be a long-term investor—until the market takes a downturn.

I bought 100 shares of AAPL at $14/share circa 2002/2003. Sold it about a year later after it more, or less, doubled, but before iPod revenue really started hitting the bottom line, and obviously several years before the iPhone even became a thing.

IF I had held it from then until now (I am confident I would have sold at least some shares along the way), after the splits, etc., I'd have 5,600 shares valued at a little over $1.4 Million today.

I recently made [this table](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hdxxw6/broadcom_avgo_broke_the_1t_barrier_heres_how_it/) comparing the different "Mag 7" stocks + Broadcom. NVDA's growth has slowed down and will continue to do so, but it's still the best growth stock among the group with the best operating margins. The data don't tell the full story of each company, but the pattern is quite clear.
----------------------------------------
Comment by Prudent-Corgi3793 at 2024-12-30 04:52:11+00:00:
Yes, but I think this comes with acceptable risk, especially at a reasonable forward PE for a growth stock. I feel reasonably confident about NVDA for the next few years; I can't say I feel fully confident about NVDA for the next two decades, but that goes with almost any company.

It will benefit quite a bit for at least some of the next four years, or as long as Musk remains in favor. But even if that quadrupled its inherent value, it would still be overpriced.

[Microsoft](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MSFT/microsoft/operating-income), [Apple](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/operating-income), and [Alphabet](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/operating-income) made $30.6B, $29.6B, and $28.5B, respectively, in operating income **last quarter alone**. [Tesla](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/operating-income) has made $32.0B in cumulative operating income **in its entire corporate lifespan** (data from 2010 to the present day)--and as you can see from the graph in the link, it peaked in 2022, so it's not even growing.

Piggy backing off this comment. Studies do show lump sum is always better than DCA over extended periods of time. Unless you are in an extended bear market, if you are DCA’ing you are always buying higher.

Comment by poppingcalc at 2024-12-29 23:02:57+00:00:
That's hindsight though right? If you had known NVDA was going to rip up you would have bought. If you believe in a company and it's fundamentals and you want to do long term investing then just set aside savings every month and DCA.
----------------------------------------
Comment by DePoots at 2024-12-29 23:59:42+00:00:
With that mindset, you should’ve bought TSLA 5 years ago, but because you didn’t, you might as well just not buy anything? 

Time in the market beats all. You are unlikely going to time the market well. If you want potential for more growth, you must risk it and buy into individual stocks that you believe will grow more valuable over time. 

Otherwise just buy into the market now, and keep buying more as time goes on. Even if we take a downturn, you will be averaging out your cost basis, and will hit your break even point sooner.

I agree but let’s take someone like me in current time. Buying a bigger company’s stock like the MAG 7 is tough because they are all already expensive and have little to gain compared to a smaller company, but that smaller company is also WAY riskier. What is your advice on buying expensive stock prices for bigger companies in the MAG 7. You could you convictions on all of them so which of the 7 are worth it? Is something like Sofi/PLTR worth it instead because they are smaller cap.

Bought TSLA with at 220 and it went down to 160 this year. With Musk openly playing politics and threat of walkout if he is not paid his 60 billion, any sensible investors would sell this stock and I did. Turned out I was wrong.

You can complain all you want but i’m not the one in control and the market doesn't care about our feelings on green or red days, on corrections, recessions or even all-time highs. If you're scared then why not just wait it out for however long you want? I’m not the customer service so i can't help with your fear. The market moves up and down with or without us.

This is why long term investment pay off. TSLA is essentially flat from 2014 to 2019. It's an explosive stock with long dormant period.

When it gets to a level that it starts to affect your thinking in unrelated topics, thats when theres signs its unhealthy. When someone brings up an unrelated topic, and you need to think of an asset thats "unethical" to own, and what comes to mind are Tesla and bitcoin....it shows that youre a bit divorced from reality and probably too fixated on hating anything your mind associates with elon.

Russian or Saudi oil? Conflict diamonds? Monsanto, Phillip Morris, Chinese sweat shops, companies irresponsibly marketing addictive drugs, weapons manufacturers? No, the first thing I think of when I think of whats wrong with the world is an electric car manufacturer and tokens on a distributed computer protocol. Rofl give me a break.

Teslas architecture has a higher ceiling and V13 is significantly better than 12. There is evidence of exponential progress which will become clear very soon. This is how AI works, and all deniers need do is observe progress of LLMs last 2 years. I was never convinced they were close until I saw the gap between V12 and V13. You need to take new evidence and have the ability to change your mind. Living in ignorance is dangerous. Remindme! 2 years

Is it the first time you hear of someone purchasing shares on a monthly basis?
Look at MSFT chart, at what point do you think a guy who is obsessed with timing the market should opt-in for MSFT? The last BIGGEST opportunity of entry was the dot com bubble and the smallest one compared to that was Covid and the year 2022 but that is almost laughable because even still--

 ever since then....While you're waiting, the price goes up, there are corrections sure but the company's valuation literally goes up right before our eyes... like seriously what is it that you want? You want me to just sit and do nothing but watch MSFT becoming more expensive as the day go by and i don't purchase any more shares before it costs, €500, €600, €700 and someday even €1,000 if they dont do a stock split before that???

You're acting like i’m purchasing shitcoins at its highest peak due to FOMO or popularity. Did you even read what i said about MSFT being a wide most company? If you’re questioning my decision to buy shares on a monthly basis, just wait until you hear about those who buy every single week.

I love AMZN as well. They're growing very well not just in AWS, but in Advertising as well, and in their 3rd Party Services. 

For Advertising, it will be interesting to see how they continue to grow with them getting some of the NBA season games next year 2025-2026. More and more Live sports are coming to streaming and that will give a lot of Ads. 

For 3rd Party Services, Chinese companies like Temu are a competitor but Amazon can very well compete against them. 

And their long-term bets like Zoox and Project Kuiper... They're a long way off to judge at this point, but an example of their long-term thinking which has given them so much success, like with AWS. 

AWS though... Is very exciting. They're investing a lot in their AI and Bezos has been investing his time all in AI. They released Nova recently, 4 models for it. And the common word in all 4 descriptions was "cost". Just like always, they're thinking about the Cost to the customer, and they are, as always, customer focused. 

So yeah. I love Amazon. 

I also love Google! Their Search revenue is still growing at about 12% last quarter. Their YouTube is still growing 12%. And best of all, their Google Cloud grew 35%. Their Google Cloud revenue is now more than YouTube revenue at $11B. They're still third place behind AWS and Azure, but they're very much catching up. This is a huge jump. 

Google is not dying. Google Search is going to evolve with AI. And this December, they released a lot of news/products relating to their AI and Gemini that is incredible. They're very much in the race against OpenAI, and might just have caught up. 

Their investment in TPUs has been a huge benefit in Cloud and their AI for Gemini. Gemini 2.0 is built on their TPUs, not on Nvidia. Why does that matter? Cost. The operating costs for Google to run their Gemini AI, will be a lot more cost efficient than OpenAIs. And the computer for AI is *expensive*. But Gemini 2.0 Flash released this month is literally free. Google may not have released a model to match O3 which isn't launched yet, but google can release models cheaper and just as good as O1, or close. 

I need more money to buy these 😂💲

Hey, investment noob and lurker here. I just wanted to comment on PayPal specifically as there's currently a "scandal" with Honey (which was acquired by PayPal in 2022 for 4 billion) stealing commissions from their ad partners. I'm not sure exactly how much it will affect the investment side, but worth considering. I think legal action will be taken because lots of shady stuff was happening. Hope it helps!!!

AUVPQ. You can't get it, but mark it down. I think I'll walk away with nearly $250k. I printed off their sec filings before they filed for bankruptcy, and I'm confident in their ability to pay for these preferred shares, in full, even if they have to liquidate, which I highly doubt will happen. Their total assets are nearly twice their total liabilities. It was just a problem with timing and cash flows, when they switched to different production lines.

In general, Argentinian Index Funds will see explosive growth as Argentina is leaving the almost 10-year old recession and is finally growing again because of the foreign purchases tax cuts, end of money printing, and business confidence on the president and his promised investments in nuclear energy and further tax cuts for 2025.

I Even mowed my own grass for the first time, because it gave me something to do. Life’s good now……I know Im old…but should I get a PlayStation or Xbox?

The average investors doesn't look beyond price action. If the price goes up it is the best stock in the world, if the price goes down it is the worst stock.


You can see this pattern everywhere, nobody was talking about Palantir when it was $7-$20 USD, now everyone recommends it as an investment at insane valuation. Everyone was bashing Reddit at IPO, how trash it is, how much porn, how many bots etc, now it is more than 3x higher and everyone is bullish on it. PayPal same situation when it was at $50. Nvidia was a dead company in 2022 according to Reddit.


I have countless examples.

I won’t buy HIMS on principle.  Was a customer and their shifty lock-in practices pissed me off.  Then I realized I could just get a script from my Dr. and spend less OTC at my local pharmacy.

In short, they will continue to bill your cc even if you don’t take action to renew your prescription by doing a consult.  You actually have to take action to cancel, and they put up barriers to make it as difficult as possible.  You actually need to call in to cancel.  It’s an awful customer experience and I’ll never return.  Reminds me of AOL back in the day.  Any company putting churn practices in place that value quarterly earnings calls over their customers struggles over the long term.

They may get destroyed when the FDA pulls generic GLP-1's off the market as production shortages have eased. Most of $HIMS run-up has been on large sales numbers of these generics they will no longer be able to sell.

20% growth is still pretty good and its an improvement from past few years. The market gets saturated, 50%+ growth each year is not sustainable and that early growth represented their entry into a a fresh market.

I have no idea how that matches expectations, and I'm not investing in AMZN anyway - but most companies would consider +20% YOY growth excellent in most cases :)

Literally 5% of revenue was from their GLP-1s last quarter. Is that what you define as large? Like another comment mentioned here subs like these are just hive minds that don’t hop on the bandwagon until the stock is up 3-4X.

I'll just add that things don't have to be good for market upside. 

A "good to great" or "ok to good" aren't the only times when things go up. Sometimes it's just a situation shift from "horrible to bad" or "bad to ok" that lifts up the asset value in question.

I'd personally stay away until January unless you're buying stocks.

Im sure amzn will rip near earnings because of Christmas sales obviously. But one market correction will cause this to drop which would be the ideal buy in. Its also up right now so you just got IV fucked and you'll lose on theta as well as delta.

Bullish but too early of a buy if you ask me.

You haven't seen anything. Just this past August, the market tanked twice this hard and the VIX jumped to Covid/great recession/dot-com-bubble levels because the Bank of Japan increased their interest rates by *.1%.*

The market is complete bullshit, completely detached from fundamentals and reality, and the weakest call of it's bluff will cause days like today. 

And you have to play it that way.

This is a case of 2 things:

1) Sell the news. The entire market has been pumping in anticipation of the rate cuts and today was the final one for 2024. So sell the news.

2) Most companies that reported gave a poor 2025 outlook. MU today just the most recent example.

Ahh yes, healthcare is up because our monthly payments for the life saving heart surgery will be lower. Now they can squeeze the difference for the anal lube fee.

This situation reminds me of  recent HOA meeting:

ACC chairman: With Bert leaving the ACC, I appointed Cedric to the committee.

Board President: You have no authority to appoint someone. The Board appoints ACC members. We would be glad to consider Cedric, but we are going to ask if others would also like to be on the committee. 

ACC Chairman: You don't like Cedric?

Board President: Cedric is a fine fellow, but you do not have authority to appoint anyone. Only the Board can do that, and we want to let any other interested to also be considered. 

ACC Chairman (interrupting): You don't like Cedric?

How was it bs? Lol. The market was way above where it should be. We had a bit of a correction. The  U.S. economy is in shambles. We haven't had more than a 10%pb in a while. Today was only 3%. Honestly, there is no reason we aren't in a full-blown recession as many other countries have gone in lately. All you can do is say, market gonna market. Trade what they give, not what you want. As soon as momentum slows, get out, stay green, and wait for the next entry.

I cashed out last week and bought a smallish position on the market tanking by last Friday. Only 3 trading days off, I would have flipped $300 into several grand, RIP. Still I locked in 85% on the year, can't complain too much.

  
Now to chill for a couple of months and buy back in when the tanking truly starts.

Okay. Thats not what he said. They cut the number of rate cuts next year back from 4 to 2, and he implied they may just do 1, and probably later than expected. Thats plenty enough of impact on leverage for growth and thatch PEs to drive this kind of action.

Its simple. 

We are taught and repeated it's already factored in. 

Its NEVER factored in. Ever. 

Too many people are chasing irrational returns at all levels for that to occur. 

Tsla a prime example. They have to replace MULTIPLE  entire industries to reach an equivalent value. 


MSTR is a god damn ponzi scheme based around pretend money that only has value because we as a people say, yeah that imaginary thing has value. It's now part of the actual index. 

All while AI bubble keeps building....but as of right now ZERO ROI to actual results. 

2025 is going to suck.

Comment by Handy_Dude at 2024-12-19 14:52:03+00:00:
Same shit happened to me. I spent a month paper trading gold futures in preparation to day trade it. By the end of the month I was entirely too confident. I blasted my way on to thinkorswim  one morning in my undies, dick swinging... I set up a trade, executed and then threw my feet up on my desk, hands tucked behind my head. 

Within seconds the price dropped so fast it blew out my stop loss. My arms immediately sort of dove from the back of my head for the keyboard and mouse, twisting my body and pulling my feet off the desk. The chair somehow found new life in its wheel bearings and skedaddled the fuck out of their causing me to land square on my ass. 

So there I was a 26 year old man. In my undies, sitting on my butt, reaching up to my desk like a toddler to his parents. As I got up, I was locked into the price it had already dropped -$500.  By the time I got up, got the sell order in, and sold, I lost $800. I was devastated. That was the worst feeling ever. Mostly because my gf loaned me some of the money cause she saw me paper trading and was confident in me. Ugh. Just writing about it bums me out... Definitely learned from that lesson though.

As long regards keep buying the dip, there won't be any dip, it's a mere blackfriday sale.   
We have unlocked the secret of stocks, when it dumps, you pump, as long we keep pumping, we can keep the value of our stocks, well until we run out of money to pump, that's why we need interest to go 0 or negative, we will just borrow and keep pumping.

Market is down 3% and shiller PE is at its third highest value ever?


3% has never once in the history of the market been an over-reaction. 50% has been an over-reaction before. 


Losing 50% from these levels would make valuations *average*.


If we lost 70% from this level we'd still be looking at valuations more than double the 1982 minimum.

Finviz has a nice homepage that has it.   

Posted this exact same post here about three or four years ago, with almost the exact same title, and the most common reply, was people asking where to find the heat map.  Since then, most sites have the heat maps.  WeBull desktop app has a good one too, which is clickable.

And didn't Oreo re-release double stuffing too recently??? I think I saw a post about it... or wait, that was someone with their cat's paw in-between two Oreo cookies.  Must have confused the algos.

Isn't there some old thing that when Oreo has double stuffing, markets tank?

You know what I’ve noticed? Nobody panics when things go “according to plan.” Even if the plan is horrifying! If, tomorrow, I tell the press that, like, a gang banger will get shot, or a truckload of soldiers will be blown up, nobody panics, because it’s all “part of the plan”. But when I say that one little old mayor will die, well then everyone loses their minds. Introduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos.

AI can have ROI whenever it wants to.

The AI are still learning now, and already tons of people are using them right now (for free). Companies are even restructuring around AI by downsizing staff count.

Once AI is entrenched into business operations, all they have to do is kick in the subscription fee and companies would have little choice but to subscribe, because it's still cheaper than paying for more employees.

It has tremendous amount of profit.  So many $150k/year white collar finance majors who will be out of a job in the next 2-3 years..  and that’s just one function..  add operations, IT automation, etc.  only folks safe are the trades..

Comment by Plenty-Mess-398 at 2024-12-19 04:15:29+00:00:
My question is, is it really irrational or just inflation coming to the surface? M2 money supply has more than doubled over 10 years. Steady 5-10% levels. Inflation figures are pretending there‘s barely any inflation.      

Everyone assesses overpriced markets pointing at the Buffet indicator. But since this indicator was invented the money in circulation has quadrupled. Inflation rates do not seem to represent this as far as my limited amount of brain activity can detect. 

So while I agree with unstable markets, they aren‘t irrational ATHs if there‘s lots of hidden inflation. Which clearly there is. Now if I had more brain cells I could tell you if the quantity theory of money inflation is any more accurate than the figures we’re being told and what difference it would make if we used these  figures instead. I will research it tomorrow and share my findings. Just kidding I will yolo my life savings into Microstrategy as soon as I feel like it has dropped enough without doing any further research into anything at all because being financially irresponsible is trendy and I was told to not bet against market trends.

to be a bear about this for a moment:

the US is the only economy not in a recession, and even then certain sectors of it (tech, manufacturing, white collar shit in general) are, we even changed the definition of what a recession *is* for the last 2 years, literally every single quarter of jobs data was faked upward/downwardly revised, the Fed has not hit their target on inflation at all and things continue to get more expensive, zero movement on housing, earnings are literally made up, companies like PLTR are trading at 300x forward revenue, AI startups and crypto scamming is back, ChatGPT is garbage and is already over the hump of being obviously worse than a over 100 IQ human, ceos are getting murked in the streets and everyone's cheering.

Funny thing is when we were projected to get 5 rate cuts in 2024 and we only got three, markets continued to rally all year long with no issue. Today was a total overreaction. Sure we might see some short term selling but you can book it, Q1 25, possibly around January or end of February they’ll be pumping this shit again for the next several months.

We also didn't have foreigners investing from afar, retail traders gambling from their toilet, and 401ks creating a constant lift.

Markets will be elevated as long as US is dominant. 2025 is vastly different from the 1980s.

Oh. Let's also forget to mention the rates back then vs now. And let's forget about the Fed and government propping up the market and bailing the market out if it starts falling too much.

Hate to say it, but it's different. I'd prefer cheaper prices but there's too much buying pressure in the modern era. We'll have another epic crash by the end of the decade where you can buy before it recovers. Be ready, kids, shit moves fast when you're flinging it around.

Don’t disagree, to an extent.

But, best case, the market has largely priced that all in by now. 2x since Covid. There is a lot of room to the downside for shaking out.

Draw a crayon line from 08 top to Pre-Covid top, to  2022 bottom and keep going…

That line doesn’t get to current levels intil **2030**

I worked as a market maker and of course we made a market in options. That's what options market makers do. I worked on the open outcry floor of the Pacific Stock Exchange (which is now a gym). Where did you work?

Hedge funds essentially need to fuck retail traders for their liquidity right? I was just watching that leaked Jim Cramer video from ‘06 where he’s talking about it (I think the interview was supposed to be for some insiders club or some shit because he says in the beginning ‘this is the kind of stuff I wouldn’t say on tv’) so when they’re using retail for liquidity it got me thinkin (as I’m getting into options) about who they’re fucking and whatnot, it’s it essentially holders and sellers they’re using rather than options traders? Because it kind of seems like options trading is riding those waves the firms and hedges are creating

MMs are hedge to where price moves don't really hurt them. They make money by buying at bids and selling at ask prices. You can basically be a market maker yourself but there's actually regulations around it. I don't know the specifics. You would also need loads of cash to provide sufficient liquidity for the stock.

But it is because that's the value a lot of people have agreed upon. It doesn't matter if the store or value is something intangible such as binary flowing through cooper wires or green paper printed with symbols of long dead people. At the end it's the same thing, a bunch of people agree that XYZ thing has a certain value

At the same time people have never been as financially literate as today. Supply and demand. If there‘s more money AND more players then the current valuations could be at a healthy level.   

The fact that VIX jumped pretty high and the markets went down so much based on very little pessimism seems to hint towards your assessment being more likely.    

However once Buffet puts his cash into the markets it won‘t matter that much how bearish the outlook is, supply and demand. So I feel like we‘re at the mercy of market makers, orange man, winnie poo and a KGB agent or so it would seem. There‘s no precedent so anyones guess is as good as mine.

That's because it's never about interest rates, it's about language control.  If you can give a Jpow-level speech with a straight face and some bigly words, the market might piss & moan (or even moon!) *but it will generally accept the absurd idea that there's a brilliant adult in charge somewhere*.  That there is at least the concept of a plan.    
  
What's a "technical recession" if someone says everything is fine and someone else is in the back making sand into machine gods?  Doesn't matter if it is all profitable, efficient, or even wise.  Only matters that the real possibility of profit *could* be there.

A market this large on a fragile and unstable Earth is inherently a sleight of hand. The truth behind the curtains is just this and nothing more:

*The speed on the money-printing crank varies.  According to the desperation we feel.  Whether or not any of you make money is entirely up to sheer, dumb luck.*  
  
*And if things get really bad?  We beg congress for the XL Kinkos Bailout Macro-Printer 5000. Then 10 years later the economy will be mostly recovered (usually).*

Buying the dip doesn't necessarily mean investing. I think it's a good opportunity to buy into relief and sell on the bounce, likely friday for short-term trade.  50% drop on a sector in a single night does call for some kind of bounce. The top is definitely in for the quantum sector since the sentiment has shifted and it was purely euphoric market action and greed sending not only quantum stocks up and overall small and micro cap stocks flying - all markets down today. IONQ speaking at CES on Friday. Let's see what happens.

Comment by Machine_Bird at 2025-01-08 18:56:59+00:00:
Dude. A literal Google engineer on the Willow project said a month ago that quantum computing has no commercial value for at least another 3-5 years and other experts in the industry called him "optimistic" for that assessment. If you think QC is the next Nvidia you better be buying to ride the wave in 2030. If you think it's coming any sooner then you're more regarded than the rest of us.

Fair value $4 at best and that’s including speculation. They have 3M in revenue on their last earnings report. What billion dollar company makes $3M in revenue? I have no idea probably a handful or less and they likely have a debt strategy if this is the case.

Comment by apemanactual at 2025-01-08 21:48:33+00:00:
I'll be continually loading up on the QC sector for the rest of the year, and maybe into next year. And in 5 years, you'll regret not loading up on QC stocks when they're 10x current valuations. There is 0 question that QC has a very strong future. In 5 to 10 years, WSB will be nothing but posts of "Man, imagine if I had held all my shares when QUBT was $10, I'd be a multimillionaire right now". I understand this subreddit is designed for people who trade 0dte on a 1 minute time frame and will lose an entire mortgage on meme stocks before 10 am, but holy hell.

Edit: Everyone saw what NVDA CEO said today and read it as "no QC for next 15 years, dump it". What you should've read is "These companies are slightly overvalued at their current price. However there is at least a 5, maybe 10-15 year runway of positive news catalysts before the companies even begin to reach peak valuation".  And it's true that they're currently over valued. But is this a bad price to be in at in a year? 3 years? A decade? If you bought last week, sure, dump it. I however, was waiting on this exact dip. And I'll buy every dip to follow. Just because something isn't going to 100x your portfolio at market open doesn't mean it's not a good investment.

Why are y'all so bitter though?

What's wrong with people actually investing in a company/technology they believe will perform well in the future?  
What's wrong with being early to a company you think could return multiples in 10 years?

What happened to the old saying, 'time in the market beats timing the market'?

Maybe OP needs to stop and think that no everyone spends their days watching stocks.  
Some are fine parking their money in a company with potential to become the next big thing.

This is a calculated investment.  
You leave money you're willing to lose and let time do it's thing.. That's investing.

If y'all want to wait until a company is already profitable and big before investing, that's your choice.

But for me? BUT THE DIP!!

I think the main concern was that the company was worth $4 billion when they have annual revenue of $12 million and they haven’t grown significantly in the last two years. Some tech companies are similar to bio stocks with their insane price movement.

Comment by Vee_32 at 2025-01-08 20:22:05+00:00:
I think it’s important to remember, these are long term stocks. These are not a get rich overnight scheme. They will be important in the future. So while my “losses” today look ugly, I was no intending on selling today, tomorrow, next week, etc. these are long term holds. It takes time to grow wealth to be the next google, apple, Microsoft, etc. everyone now looking at those stocks can zoom out to 10 years or all time view and say, man, I wish I had got in this when it was $5…. Well guess what, that’s where these quantum stocks are right now. I’m holding. Most of my entries were below $5, so I’m still good, and if they get below that, I’ll add more. I already took out my initial investments on these when they were at their highs. I’m good right now.

I cut half my hold at $10, but I do believe this is a long hold in an industry that just hasn’t developed yet. Google just came out with something potentially legit in Willow. That’s from a Mag 7…

5 years ago we would’ve cut ties with AI. Those who didn’t are probably doing well now. Point is…don’t go “all in”. Make it an exploratory long term play. I think there’s room to grow and we’re just starting to scratch the surface of QC.

Comment by Jejed_D at 2025-01-09 11:02:55+00:00:
I am both RGTI and IONQ shareholder, 20K for the first and 1K the second I was -180K USD yesterday but still +531% and +80% gains respectively. Do I bother my last day losses? Of course I do. Do I’ll keep my QC stock? Of course I am.

I’ve been in the game for +15year now, I experience a lot of market trending such as biotech, social media, bitcoin, metaverse, AI and many others but when I see all those posts saying RGTI is shit or at the opposite that it’s the new NVDA I do feel a lot a people need to take a breath or fart a big one.

I’ve missed many trains, I first heard about bitcoin in 2015 and I had the opportunity to invest in 2017 but instead I laugh on my friend who bought it at 3K$ and was down at the time at 2K$, now who’s laughing? I still don’t hold crypto but one lesson I’ve learned from it is that you don’t need strong fundamentals or even a tangible use case to make big money from an asset. Same for NVDA, could place 20K$ when it was around 15$ when I first heard about ChatGPT in late 2022 but I was too shaky at the time, although I knew the company for a long time cause I’m a pc gamer. I made a 40% profit on NVDA later but still nothing compares to a potential x10 gain. Imo to get rich in the game you have to be humble, patient and audacious and don’t listen to the noise from people who only made daily trades with few bucks.

Yes I might lost all my investment in QC, I accept that, I already lost big money on other names and no one has crystal ball. But I see QC complementary to IA and a disruptive tech that will be at first stage support by public money. The Chinese are pushing a ton of money in QC R&D and USA will have no choice but to follow and even bet higher. Shorters are saying QC is in FOMO moment that happens only once with a tremendous spike followed by and endless agonizing downing trend, but in reality, past weeks were not the first hot moment for QC. Actually, it already had hot trending back in 2021 for IONQ (reached 28$ in Nov 2021), RGTI was introduced at 10$ 4 years ago, therefore I’m fine with the yesterday crash as recent uptrend was not sustainable. The only thing that change is that retails have now QC on their radar, which means a lot for long term perspective. Call it Tulip, bubble or whatever you want but I strongly think it is the future and here to stay so is AI, bitcoin/blockhain and all those assets that once been called meme stock. The only question is who will be the winner and when? And from a pure technical pov, QC charts reminds me crypto, something I will never hold but I recognize it can turn investors into millionaires with cycles bringing highs record follow by some long lasting winters. But on the long run you maximizing you're chance of winning.

No. Don’t buy the dip.   This isn’t the dip….. yet….. 
Close your covered calls out at a huge profit and continue to sell covered calls to make your shares free….. eliminate the risk.  Gradually sell covered calls.   
If it pans out long term. Good you’re now a millionaire.

If it tanks over the next couple years as it burns through cash reserves unable to compete with its quantum big brothers….. you’ve made money on selling covered calls and your worthless shares were free anyways

Most on these Reddit threads have never done a valuation based on earnings forecast.  They’re all fiends looking for their next hit.  A few minutes of staring at a chart and hearing a cool story about a stock and they’re pushing chips in.  It’s fucking wild.

Bought these calls when the stock was $0.66 and sold at $1.80. At its peak, I could have turned $750 in $100k if I didn’t fold my royal flush🤦‍♂️

CNBC had a guy on today who works in Quantum computing. He completely refuted what the NVDA CEO said and believes the guy does not know what he is talking about. I think it is true that NVDA is 15 years behind, but many other companies have products and are doing Quantum computing now.

Also, consider that his comments were that quantum computing is ~20 years from being commercially utilized. May be a useful part of a long term portfolio. Likely want to diversify across technologies in development, but getting in on the ‘winning’ technology early is likely to pay off. 

I think current value reflects investors future expectations. Many investors are likely well aware that this isn’t an area to expect big revenue gains in the short term, maybe today’s selloff is purging those who thought it was. Also, I’m sure many people who thought of it as a short term play made a profit selling today - at its price from about two weeks ago.

Comment by GloriousPeen at 2025-01-09 02:12:52+00:00:
I got in at around $1.80 but only put in like $100 bc I had little faith and was planning on holding for a decade or so. Was very surprised at the pump and when it hit $20 I saw the writing on the wall and sold everything except like 10 shares lol. I can be upset that I didn’t put $30k in but whatever you can’t see the future and I’ll take an easy $1k thanks. People “buying the dip” is insane lmao. It’s over you missed the train try again next time. If you believe in qc then wait a couple months for the hype to die down then buy with intention of long term holding.

The smartest thing these companies can do is offer a massive secondary all of them at w.e they can sell it for.

Raise enough money to remain operational for years.

Maybe when the technology becomes cost effective and useful they can spin off the profitable bit and let the rest wither and die.

People buying the dip on this are on there way to create a fantastic tax loss for the 2025 tax year.

When these companies crumble the next recession starts.

Quantum is wild. It’s been a terrible buy the news call since day one. That said, it’s always a terribly buy the news stock, people have short memories and the news will cycle through quantum again in a year or so, or you can realize those losses and
Move on. Just consider the vast amount of drone/uap FUD out there, and the ever creeping idea that it’s AGI running on quantum…

It would take several orders of magnitude more than the entire planet's computing resources to simulate a pencil falling over down to the atomic level. Yet it is very easy to simulate a pencil falling over by just doing it for real. Quantum computing attempts to turn the latter into numbers.

Chucked in a few hundred @ $2.76 and was surprised at the rocket like trajectory since then. Was wholly expecting a crash soon, came very close to selling yesterday at whatever insane price it was, so missed out there, but still a triple bagger so alright with that. Just sold out as I expect a bounce down, will buy back in when at more realistic values, might just carry on going up and if so that great, hopefully it'll become more stable in time.

  
Still trying to learn the art of Zen investing, long term views on most things and not really concerned with short term noise, detach all emotion from the process. People who have lost out here might consider just holding on for 10+ years, as mentioned it could very well be one of those awesome long term stocks and could perform welk if treated as such.

RGTI was a $4B market cap with $12M in sales for the last 12 months. IONQ was a $10.8B market cap with revenue of $37M. They all needed to come back to reality unless their revenue was about to shoot up 1000%.

Obviously no one bought RGTI or other quantum stocks out of fundamentals. It's just predicting what's the next "big" thing news wise after AI. I got into RGTI around 1.7 after seeing DWave following the IonQ pump, thinking that RGTI is the only other player that still hasn't pumped. That's all. It's just trend reading, looking at volumes, and buying the remaining key player(s) for a calculated bet.  I limited my downside buying at that price point and so I was comfortable investing a sizeable amount as initial capital. Sold half at $3-4 to let the rest ride, and then took profits along the way. Anyone who chased subsequently and blindly did not limit their downside and that's just dumb trading behavior that lacks discipline.

If you didn’t recognize this insane run up in these penny stock quantum names was exactly like the ridiculous run up in SPACs a few years ago I don’t know what to tell you. Yeah sure, it’s fun to gamble and people can make some money playing these names but likely you’re gonna get burned at some point. I’m glad I pulled all my super spec plays back to under .5% of my portfolio over the last couple of weeks. If they all went to zero it’d be fine with me, of course I don’t hope that happens.

Jensen said a certain data center would take 4 years to build. Elon built it in 19 days. Thats 76x faster than expected. Based on the decades Jensen mentioned in making quantum feasible let’s use about 4 to overshoot. 40 years is 14,600 days. Using my quant skills in about 192 days from now is when quantum will be fully realized. Trust me bro.

I don't think quantum computers will EVER be very useful. They will never replace data centers. We might find some tasks that are uniquely suited to quantum but even that is far off.

Your right - there is still no product for this market.. BUT it is a super interesting long term bet - because if and when one of these quantum companies hits the target they could become larger than  NVIDIA - which is probably why the comment was made in the first place..

Comment by Im_Fr3aKiN_0uT at 2025-01-09 10:48:46+00:00:
Here's the stupid part. That guy made the comment he did BELIEVING it was true, which is exponentially worse, mainly for NVIDIA. QBTS came out and outright shunned the comment as false. They are actively making money off quantum, NOW. This is NOT a 10, 20, 30 year away tech; it's here now, and it will only get bigger. if you honestly think this is anything more than a dip you are the truest regard of regards. It will go back up, but much slower than before, likely. Quantum is going to create massive earnings and future outcomes for these companies. The first earnings call for QBTS is going to triple the price of the stock, regardless if we are in a bearish market from this crappy 10yr rate. Mark my words- when QBTS starts talking about how much they are making on quantum, the entire quant market is going to have a field day. This is literally the same as the launch of the first PC or the internet. People had no clue, and everyone doubted it. You can choose to be on one of two sides of history here. I'm not saying 2025 is the year of quant, but mark my words that before 2030 it will be one of the top influences across the market. Everyone will be using it. Get left behind or don't. Your call.

I just buy ETFs so it doesn't matter what they say. I buy the QTUM ETF monthly and keep dollar cost averaging. I don't plan on selling for another 20+ years anyways. 

Also, I do believe quantum computing will change the world and it will inevitably be here regardless of whatever statements a CEO makes. They are human like us and can make mistakes like anyone else. No one knows for sure when it will actually arrive. All you can do is prepare. But selling your stock out of fear is not preparing for the inevitable.

Do you know how many double digit days upward this thing had over the last two months? All you had to do was roll calls into more calls. Smart people bought puts over the last several weeks. We will see if smart people bought the dip for short term gains. That’s all it is.

None of the quantums have fundamentals so the sp can't be predicted and none of them are priced based on current reality.


Your post doesn't take into consideration rgti was probably a short attack victim after Jensen's words (and Cramer's) or the share price was manipulated down to scare retail into selling so the institutions can buy  cheap shares only to sell them back to the same sellers at higher prices on the way back up.


Nothing changed fundamentally or financially for rgti's share price to tank, except Jensen's words giving the shorts an excuse to attack. Everyone knows the story on quantum stocks and the prices were baked in.  You sound very uninformed about how the market works by blaming the drop in share price solely on unrealistic valuations



Additionally there are plenty of reasons to buy rgti, anyone can access their quantum capability on Amazon's  AWS cloud (Braken) or Microsoft's Azure for a fee, and President Trump gave billions to quantum companies in his first term and will do the same once he's in office again.

I am an investor with a Computer Science background. Anybody who knows anything about quantum computing knows that we know almost nothing about quantum computing. So if we don't know much, how can we make money with it? That's why research has been going on for decades. Quantum is always "20 years away". Current Physics understanding is not sufficient to produce practical results. We also don't really have many practical use cases that would be commercially viable. The Google news was a nothingburger. Most computing problems can still be solved more efficiently with traditional computing + AI. Quantum will remain niche at best for a while.

"If somebody says they know Quantum Mechanics, it means that they don't know Quantum Mechanics".

We're about to, and in the process of, witnessing a glorious RUGPULL of investors who have know idea what the underlying even does. You're really no better than a crypto trader.

I knew that all this quantum nonsense, along with crypto, china, air taxis... jeez. This really is peak bubble. I knew that all of this is BS. But like most bear cases, you're going to lose until there's a major catalyst. And that would be Jensen's words as an expert, what most of us in the CS/Physics/CE space already knew, but you'd get burned shorting since October. Made a nice 50% gain on OTM puts overnight, hoping to see IONQ settle back to reasonable valuation at $10.

Agree, moment I got in at 10.55 per share I never was as anxious before. It dropped below 10 that day, 4 days later I got out at 10.89. Think I made a $100, but didn't regret going out of it a second. With IONQ I understand that with their trapped ion solution they have unique capabilities that might hold the key to unlock quantum computing beyond the few qubits capacity we have these days (it's still a bet, but it's something unique). With RGTI I was just following along with the hype, had no idea what made this company so much better than all the others.

He was asked a question, and he gave an honest answer. It wasn't strategic. It was off- the-cuff.


The fact that it had this kind of impact, is incredibly telling. RGTI, IONQ, etc., investments were purely speculative at prices above $5.

Comment by mythrowawayheyhey at 2025-01-08 23:26:00+00:00:
I mean I had all of my IONQ and RGTI shares sold off from stop losses today.

That's fine, that's why I put the stop losses in place.  I've been riding this speculative rollercoaster for months.  You can bet I bought back in at the bottom once it started showing signs of life, but for more shares than I had yesterday.

If Jensen or another GPU/CPU company CEO comes out tomorrow and says "actually I was wrong, it'll be 20 years before QPUs can do anything useful," then I'll thank him again while my shares sell off on Friday, and I'll buy back in twice as hard when the price settles at an apparent floor.

The technology has very profound implications on computation, and just because we may not see a QPU in our home computer for 10 or even 20 years, or whatever kind of marker y'all are setting, it doesn't mean that companies developing it aren't worth investing in.  Nor does it mean that these stocks will flatline.  They surged for a reason.  And that reason will only become more apparent over time.

I will increase my # of shares as the price drops, and then I will hold.

The serious flaw in the plan is that I'm banking on RGTI or IONQ being as integral of a company as I'm sure QC will be for modern computing down the line.  That may or may not happen, I don't know.  For all I know, either one of them are duds in terms of the company 5 years down the line.  The technology, though, I am entirely sold on.

So... I am buying into this specifically because I see it as a very, very, very good long-term investment.  We're complaining about $10 and $20 drops now on stocks that were, a couple of months ago, penny stocks.  Last week we were complaining about $5 and $10 drops.

The fact that the wind was momentarily taken out of its sails by a mere comment from a GPU company CEO doesn't really mean anything in terms of the potential value of the investment.

You falsely assume that these companies will be able financially last that long.  You can invest now thinking you'll 100x your money in the next decade but you won't if they go bankrupt or stay alive through constant dilution like they do now. In that case your investment will be worth nothing anyway by the time the the stock price actually goes 100x and you still won't make any money.

you cant wheel your way out of a 20x stock. calls will get eviscerated but so will your shares. 

its not worth it. you don't wheel stocks that moon like this

Yeah, but I love coming here and finding those potential trades to research.  Never would I have heard of eVOTLs if I didn't lurk here.  Made 400% gains on ACHR, still holding for the long-term (two years) on that one for sure.  That was early enough to make a benefit to my portfolio by hearing about such companies here.  

No one could have predicted the push into Quantum stocks without knowing about the GOOG breath thru, but after reading up I had no interest in buying those because the technology is still so far away.  However, I am now lurking the QTUM etf and waiting for the dip in that to bottom before buying.

The fact of the matter is that his opinion did count. Significantly.


I'm not saying that Quantum and perhaps RGTI won't go to the moon at some point in the future.


I'm saying, think about what justifies buying in at whatever price you're considering.


If RGTI fundamentals were solid, a throwaway comment from Jensen wouldn't have tanked half it's market cap. That's the point being made here.

Ionq barely makes revenue, though.
Consider mvst. They traded at 18 cents as a profitable company pulling in 100 million rev.
Ionq only pulls in 12 million rev and traded at 50.

Fundamentals matter.
Meta had far better fundamentals when it crashed to 90.

You've got a strategy and are in for long haul. Not what my post is addressing. Of course it makes sense to average down in your position.


I'm talking to the vast majority who see buying this dip as a chance to make a quick buck, rather arbitrarily.

TSLA was in a very different spot to RGTI.

For everyone TSLA success story, with the accompanying "See, I told you" quips... there's hundreds if not thousands of well predicted failures.

I'm not saying RGTI will fail, or not to invest. I think the point I'm making above is more specific and clear.

“Anybody who knows anything about quantum computing knows that we know almost nothing about quantum computing” 

If nobody knows anything about quantum computing than nobody can know when we might know something. The timing of it is unknown. Had Jensen said quantum stocks were overhyped currently due to online sentiment and various other factors that would have been irrefutable.

After the market went completely apeshit I bailed. I made so much fucking money but it's absolutely not worth it at these price levels. If they get back to being penny stocks, I'll buy more LEAPS.

The fact that it had this impact is telling that people buying quantum computing stocks did not know what they were buying.  10 year away technology, if lucky, is not something investors want their money sitting in. 

When the GOOG announcement came, it was also caveated that this doesn't mean we will see quantum computing anytime soon.  But no one wanted to listen to that and bought in now before all the monies could be earned.  Now realizing it is too soon, everyone is jumping ship, rightfully so.  A year from now, buy 100 shares in the QTUM etf to get in cheap and early, and then forget you have 100 shares of QTUM for the next 10 years.

Comment by Enough-Mud3116 at 2025-01-09 01:27:25+00:00:
This is the way I'm seeing this. The biggest assumption you're making is "I'm banking on RGTI or IONQ being as integral of a company."

I want to argue that since quantum computing has a time scale of more than 10 years, there is a very high likelihood that another company holds the reins as the foremost quantum company. It’s risky to speculate at this time that these companies are "the ones," especially when the field is still in its infancy. Quantum computing requires breakthroughs in hardware, error correction, and applications, and many of these advancements may emerge from startups or even academic labs that don’t exist yet.

We’ve seen this play out in other tech industries. Companies that look promising early on can be overtaken by later entrants with disruptive technology or better execution. Right now, the market feels too nascent and fragmented to confidently predict the long-term winners. 

For example, while NVIDIA entered the GPU market in the late 1990s, it was considered just one of many GPU manufacturers. In the 2000s, NVIDIA pivoted toward general-purpose GPU computing with CUDA (released in 2006). This was a game-changer in industries like AI, machine learning, and scientific computing, where GPUs became integral. While competitors like ATI (acquired by AMD) focused on traditional gaming GPUs, NVIDIA’s foresight allowed it to dominate emerging fields like deep learning which were fields that weren't on most companies' radar at the time.

Another story for the WSB regards, Intel was riding high on its throne, flexing its dominance with minimal innovation, basically selling overpriced chips on the back of its reputation. They milked the same outdated architecture for YEARS while raking in fat profits. Then Ryzen dropped in 2017, and AMD pulled a full-on uno reverse card. By the time AMD hit Zen 3, Intel was legit getting ratioed in every category. AMD straight-up cucked Intel in front of the entire PC gaming and workstation community, and Intel's only response was basically, “Just wait, we’re working on it!”

My plan is to sell 14dte OTM CC on a regular basis to scale positions initially and then once I'm at an average price and share count that I like, use CC premiums to continually diversify. I'd expect QC companies to be filing an offering sometime very soon if they have a pending shelf registration, knowing that their bubble has popped and they need to extend their cash runway off the back of the current run up, which will be a great opportunity to snag some shares at a good average price. Short OTM CC will be a solid way to hedge the positions and generate capital while waiting on the next big profit taking opportunity as these companies hit milestones and breakthroughs on what will hopefully be a long and fruitful road to achieving true quantum computing.

Even better…..  implied volatility is through the roof….. making them more valuable than they should be.  
The only reason you should be concerned about the price of the underlying is if your covered calls are at risk of being assigned
I forgot this is Wall Street bets.   Everybody looking for that lottery winner 

My point is one is never intending to vacate the position no matter what and the best way to make money while holding the position is to sell covered calls 
Roll the positions when necessary

The fact that there's a semi decent chance that RGTI moons in the next 10 years is a good enough reason to buy. If it has 25 billion dollar market cap in 2035, I will have 10x'd the investment I did today. Where tf else do you find casual ten baggers like that? Certainly won't 10x your money if you invest in NVDA.

I'm not disagreeing about the lack of rgti fundamentals.  But I am agreeing with your point of irrationality - which is the epitome of wsb.

This clown market is devoid of sensical investing, and I'm gambling that irrationality favors my ionq calls.

Yeah I learned it the hard way with pennies. The crash can be severe. 

With RGTI, I got in at $3 and out at $11 after reading up a bit on the short/medium term outlook for quantum computing, combined with a general feeling that it was turning into a meme stock. 

No harm leaving some of the profits in for a long term flutter but too risky holding it all.

one of my buddies is obsessed with IONQ. bought most of his shares in the $7-9 range and made a killing when it was over $50, but never sold. he also bought RGTI and QUBT which he did get stopped out of, so at least he didnt lose money there, but the gains that he left on the table by not cashing out at 6-7x for IONQ is honestly just sad

I tried to tell him that he already hit big with a 7x in just 3 months, and that he should trim but he didnt listen and he lost 70k overnight from jensen speaking two sentences, lmao

QBTS is on my radar for January 31st lol.  At that point, I will buy back in hard.  Til then, I need the realized losses :D

For anyone who read what I wrote and was even mildly convinced and who doesn't like to monitor their portfolio, QTUM, in my view, is definitely a good call right now, like NOW, friday morning pre-market.  But like usual you should buy in slowly.  If you want to invest, then at least do it throughout a single day, if not a week, or two weeks, or a month.

That way, you don't get hit too hard when you accidentally buy at an unfortunate price point.  This *IS* still all speculative.  But like I've been saying for months, it's well-warranted speculation, and quantum stocks are the kind of stocks that could justifiably go to the moon.  This isn't game stop nonsense.

Comment by mythrowawayheyhey at 2025-01-09 01:41:57+00:00:
Thanks, I definitely consider this to be a reasonable criticism.  And it's one that I'm definitely trying to take into consideration, and it's why I pointed out that it was the "serious flaw in the plan."

It's also why I'm throwing money at the wall somewhat indiscriminately.  Are you a credible QC company?  If so, then I will buy some of your shares.  Are you a massive player who has obvious credibility in terms of carrying out something like advancing quantum computing, but your shares are hundreds of dollars?  Okay maybe I just buy 5 of your shares.  You're really expensive lol.

And I mean honestly, if you're going to win big here investment-wise, it's going to be off of a company that makes its name entirely off of quantum processing units.  Otherwise you're just investing in big tech like usual.

Yes... if neither RGTI nor IONQ are actually able to realize the benefits of the technology and turn them into a massive profit such that they are an integral player, then my shares in them don't mean anything.

But man... I'll be honest... I'm looking at them at like I was looking at AMD and NVDA when I was 19, and you can bet I would have invested in them back then if I had any money.

I spent my teenage years saving up for and building shitty DIY computers with shitty graphics cards in 90s computers, mostly AMD because they were the "cheap" option.  I'd be incredibly rich right now if someone gave me $20k back then and told me what to invest in.  I would have invested very heavily in both, and I would have lost a decent amount of money on Intel.  My primary target would have been AMD.

Have I actually spent time like the teenage me, installing QPUs into my home computer?  No.  But I have browsed their websites and they're pretty sweet :D.  I think a company like IONQ or RGTI, that is actually advancing computational technology, is *far* more valuable than a company like space X or TSLA.  And it's not just because Elon Musk is an idiot.  It's because the technology is far more valuable.  There is still room for a massive surge here.

I'm hoping that just like when I was buying AMD products back in the 90s, the same holds true for today.  Today, I'm a software developer with a degree in computer science and I honestly have researched quantum computing enough to convince me, per my college education in computer science, that this is game changing once it is realized.  I'm hoping that my particular investments in the technology pay off long term, and I'm entirely and fully willing to throw money at the wall of this technology, even if some of it doesn't stick.  And when it doesn't stick, I take it back down and try to throw it again, at a lower cost threshold.

At what cost?


You’re banking on RGTI hitting a $25 billion market cap by 2035, but come on, a "semi-decent chance" isn’t exactly a slam dunk. Quantum computing is cool and all, but it’s still unproven at scale, and who knows how many other companies will eat RGTI’s lunch before then?


Plus, let’s not ignore the opportunity cost here. You’re locking up your money for 10 years on the off chance this thing moons. What’s the plan if it flops? That’s a decade where you could’ve made steady, solid gains on something less risky.


And yeah, NVDA might not 10x, but it doesn’t have to. A 2x or 3x on a proven company with real profits beats rolling the dice on a stock that could just as easily go to zero. Most people don’t even hold for 10 years... especially when the hype fades and the volatility kicks in (today being a good example).

In a few years it will already be uo pretty decently. I mean shit, Im up 30% from yesterday and I'm nowhere near scaled in. They don't have to reach true quantum computing for the stock to grow, every step they take in that direction will fuel growth. If I had to guess, they're probably back to peak valuation by EOY, if not making new highs. Will they out out multiple offerings? Likely, but that's simply a good time to scale in at good value.

Why does it matter if they pay a dividend or not? If they think they can provide better shareholder value by investing in itself verses giving it to the shareholders they will.

Where do you see a sell off? Prices of most things are close to ATH and higher than a month ago or so.

This is my list of stocks/etfs I don't currently hold and I'm looking to diversify in 2025 but it will depend on the prices. Please note that I'm a long term investor I never ever close positions except for some play money that I use to speculate on some dumps about companies that I like but I don't really see holding forever, thus all of my lists are buy once hold forever.

\- **Berkshire Hathaway**. Pricey for my standards (even Buffett stopped buybacks at those prices), but with some correction I may open a position and hold forever.

\- **Blackstone Inc**. I really like their business, financials, and the portfolio of companies they have stakes in, often not publicly traded like Flixbus or italian paid toll highways and many others.

\- **Crocs Inc**. Solid financials, strong growth, I can see that consumers that buy them would never consider another brand after.

\- **DR Horton**. US is short in houses and has to build more. DR Horton is a great company with solid financials and good growth. Currently trading at attractive prices.

\- **FTAI Aviations LTD**. Aviation is booming and is expected to keep booming for another decade. With it maintenance and repair are a huge business in which FTAI is doing good. Currently trading at around 7 times its sales, I regret not buying few months ago, but I may still be in time.

\- **McDonald's**. Just 10 days ago I was travelling in a bus in the middle of nowhere in Poland, nothing but fields and trees everywhere. And suddenly a McDonald's appears close to the road, it wasn't there last time I passed 7 months ago. It's fuckin 10.30 pm in Poland (very late in Poland, especially in winter) and there's an endless queue in their drive in and the restaurant is full. McDonald's is a great company that just keeps growing and growing and making more money and increasing dividend. One of the worst sales of Buffett in hindsight.

\- **Global accumulating ETF**. Why stock pick when I can simply bet that world economy will do well in the future?

\- **Chinese ETF**. Very depressed multiples in China, there's companies selling at nearly book value. Idiots are like "dum dum but China", yeah I know the negatives, Trump, weakening economy, etc, that's why the prices are low. It's all about risk vs premium and it's very attractive in China albeit I don't particularly love their stock market/government/transparency so I'm not rushing into it. I'm also considering few single companies (don't like Baba or JD which are fan favorites, I'm more into Baidu and similar).

I bought tons of Microsoft in this pull back. They didn’t do as well in this year compared to their peers but capex spending on AI has been super high. OAI has more to offer, and I see enterprise adopting copilot more and more. Back when Satya took over he increased investments in cloud a ton and people kept questioning when they will see the payoff. They saw it eventually and Microsoft grew like crazy. So, betting on Satya again. 

Bought some Walmart too.

When it comes I might buy some GEV, maybe META, ASML possibly.

GTX is pretty good value and down slightly. 

I bought some BJ wholesale since it's where Costco was 15ish years ago. 

And some BN.

Edit: for my tax free addition in Canada we can put 7k so I'm splitting it into 4 speculative stocks: VHI.to, TOI.V, LMN.V, and HASH.V. 7k at this point doesn't really move the needle so I may as well go for gold.

PGNY. Beaten down to a pulp this year but fundamentals are strong. Up 20% in the last week after massive insider buying. 

DRX (ADF Group) currently undervalued imo and will likely climb on news in the next six months 

WJG (LSE) Long term high risk, high reward play. When UK interest rates come down this could really fly

I don't really see much of a sell off. I am picking up some PLD as I try to diversify a bit away from the semiconductor to data center supply chain. That said, I am also buying more into that - picking up a bit more VRT and GOOGL. Finally, upping my positions in ETN and ASML.

In addition to being undervalued (IMO), they also increase their dividend every quarter, which is a plus to me.

One of the most interesting companies to me is Teleperformance (TEP). I believe that the issues with AI do not impact them significantly. They continue to generate strong revenue and are actively pursuing acquisitions. Their valuation appears solid; it just seems that the market hasn't recognized their true worth yet. Once that changes, I believe the stock price will reflect its value.

Most people wouldn't be able to handle a 40% drop of S&P500. 

There were 3 instances of such a drop in the last 100 years (1929, 2000, 2008) and each resulted in a major recession.

40% drop is not only a reddit problem, not even only a financial markets problem. It's an economic disaster leading to widespread job loss.

I've never held individual stocks for more than a few weeks.

I usually need my money for some emergency or something.

And then my 401k is just weird company ETF's. 

It's kinda weird to buy and hold stocks and just leave them alone.

But I'm finally doing it again.

The last time, when I was doing this in some old website trading platform, I had bought I think 15 shares of Visa when it IPO'd.  It was around $5k at the time.

I had to sell them a year later to buy new appliances after moving. 

Always wonder what they'd be worth.

PDD sells for around 9x earnings, growing top line at 50% (which will moderate), a fwd PEG of 0.4x. Its FCF per share is greater than its earnings per share, so it’s even cheaper in my books. I believe Temu has a lot of secular growth ahead as it’s only really been expanding overseas in the past year. The idea of buying directly via Chinese producers rather than a 3rd party is a very interesting one. They have infrastructure now that would be difficult to replicate.

Dell is a less obvious one but I think the market is massively undervaluing its data centre business. It’s growing at 35% and 58% (infrastructure group and servers group). EPS is up 16% yoy. It’s traditional business isn’t what you’re buying but from my pov you basically get it for free. PCs and laptops are cyclical with tech releases and eventually we will see a rollout of AI PCs. Dell trades at 15x earnings so it’s fairly valued, although the secular growth of data centres is probably worth a lot more

The companies product lines are quite different. LYB is the largest licensor of polyethylene and polypropylene technologies. It also produces ethylene, propylene, polyolefins, and oxyfuels.

IMHO those products are more necessary and will be more profitable in the long term than Dow’s lineup.

Dow is a fine company that is undervalued for sure!

Im from Argentina, i think my comment history might have my rationale,

However TLDR: shit ton of capex that makes P/E look inflated. Fintech division growing very strongly thanks to Argentina, historically low price to sales, and they patented for MercadoBanco (their own bank).

Im putting some money there but no more than 10% of my portfolio, the market has priced in the apocalypse, which Lula is capable of delivering even worse, but I’m following the “be greed when others are fearful” here, and this might be a great entry opportunity.

That being said these are not stocks to hold forever, when they’re dirt cheap I buy, when they’re getting from cheap to fairly valued I might be out.

Well it doesn't gain any interest that way.  $2k in a savings account will get me like a few pennies a month.

I can have my money in YMAX and QDTE and get paid weekly. 

If it drops too much I can sell before the value erodes.

I just had a baby and my fiance isn't working, so all my money has to go towards our bills. 

I was only able to save up a couple thousand, because we wanted to lay off credit card debt before the hospital bills, as we had no idea what they would cost.

I want to be able to trade the money though.

Like this last month, I made $1250 off my $2.2k account.

That money I pulled out and paid off my monthly credit card statement.

Comment by Alone_Illustrator_65 at 2025-01-02 17:39:34+00:00:
Hmmm I find your perspective quite interesting because I hold the exact opposite view regarding the holding period. 

Revenues (sales) for Meli are something like 40% Brazil, 30-40%ish Mexico, 20%ish Argentina and a negligible % of other south american countries. 

The main concern with Brazil was the real depreciation and well, pretty much the slowdown and crisis that might be inminent bc of Lula bla bla. 

However, they have a shit ton of reserves that keep the Real stable, of course, the decrease in consumption and growth that will eventually hit Brazil and MELI are still a thing, however I believe that was a bit exaggerated by the steady selling of everything Brazil related.

Considering the expansion in Argentina, the growth of their fintech and their brand (aka the Amazon of LATAM) I believe this is dirt cheap and something to accumulate and hold for the long term

Additionally, if the people of Brazil wake up in the next election (\~3 yrs), similar to argentina, we might see stupid good tailwinds. Though this is a longshot.

My point being, I feel like the impact of Lula on MELI might be overstated and MELI is dirt cheap considering their investments in growth infrastructure and their brand. 

It is circa \~35% of my portfolio, but I swear that did not bias me lol.

Here is a question that will put this into perspective for you:

What’s your total gain/loss amount from all the gambling you have done ever?

I can bet it isn’t positive.

If it’s a life altering amount if you had your losses suddenly in your bank account, then you have and are playing with your families livelihood and gambling it away and gaslighting yourself that you’re doing it for them when it could have easily been stored in an emergency fund.

Having them depend on you and gambling on their well being is cruel. Does your wife know how much you’ve lost “for her sake”?

Stop gambling what you can’t afford.

Savings with higher interests also exist. High yield savings account.

Edit: Answer is he is -$21,894 overall.

Yes these are projections of course so of course there is always the chance that it doesn’t happen exactly like this…. But they are supposed to grow 25-30 percent for the next 3 to 4 years.  Nvidia isn’t going to be able to meet the demand for its chips.  However,  AMD will be there to pick up any spill over.  AMD has some of the best central processing units on the market.  The newest ones are made for AI compatibility .  In addition the last big cycle of home and personal computers was when COVID hit in 2019 and everyone was forced to work from home.  These people all will need updated computers shortly which is part of this projection.  If that weren’t enough they make chips for gaming consoles like xbox which should be coming out with their newest models shortly.

I am Brazilian and I'm skeptical about real elections in 2026, so I wouldn't raise my hopes on that. We used 10% of international reserves in the last 2 weeks trying to hold the dollar and as you can see it's still pretty high, there is a high pessimism right now, that's why I'm betting a bit on some really beatdown companies.

I'm keeping an eye on MELI but I don't believe it's that cheap TBH, right now I bought a lot of STNE.

Understanding stock price movement as a percentage is a key knowledge point regarding this regarded discussion.

In 2024 GOOG returned 36.46%, 3 year 173.36%
In 2024 GOOGL returned 37.01%, 3 year 171.38%

‘You should be buying whichever one is cheaper’ is incorrect.   

It doesn’t matter unless you value the ability to vote or your brokerage doesn’t allow fractional shares and the delta between the two share prices is an actual barrier to purchase a full share.

Title: Top 5 stocks for 2025

Comment by Ok_Play_3044 at 2025-01-04 19:07:10+00:00:
Asml I have as well. Lbrt is my strong pick because trumps likely favourable oil and gas policies (more federal land for drilling, increase need for fracking services, plus likely more tax incentives for oil and gas companies since new head of energy is the ex ceo of lbrt) 

The whole energy transition I think is still causing undervaluation of these companies and lbrt is relatively bigger and less risky. 

If you want more volatility with the same idea try NINE or PUMP, smaller players but if the idea turns out right you could make more $$$. 

Other ones are defense stocks (particular naval building to deter China) HII and GD one makes aircraft carriers and the other makes nuclear subs (among other things). I get that it’s hard to find labour, lack of ship yards etc but the catalyst is more of Us defense budget allocated to naval buildup which is highly likely given how fast China is pumping out ships (under threat of trump tariffs, China will likely counter by being more aggressive in Taiwan and will continue with chinas naval growth which I believe will drive an increase in US naval spending.) catalyst is next US defense budget Q1 2025.


Edit: for ASML, what’s stopping players like google or Microsoft from buying equipment to vertically integrate their own AI chips? I think google is already designing their ti bypass nvda? Sure China restriction may lower short term sales but how long do we expect nvda to have their monopoly? If major players like msft or google decide to vertically integrate their own chip production, they buying asmls equipment should provide further boost to counteract any lost sales to China…. Just an idea.

> ASML

Looking at their guidance for 2025, their revenue growth is expected to be about 10-18%. It is not bad at all, but it is an expensive stock at 36 PE. 

About ASML. I understand the power of their moat and how unique their EUV product is. I also know that their products are also *very* reliable with word that some of them have lasted a decade. 

Given this, isn't there a low chance for recurring sales given the small number of customers they have? The major customers are TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. Once they buy EUV machines for their foundries, they won't need to buy a lot more would they? 

Or am I thinking this very wrong for this type of industry? 

I understand roughly 25-35% of their revenue is "recurring" from service contracts. But that isn't the major source... 

Also, China being cut off would be a major cut to their growth since they were about half their revenue at one point. 

Is all of this just par for the course when investing in a very cyclical company? 

> AMZN

I love Amazon. I wish I had bought some in the 2022 decline, but I did buy a bunch in the beginning of August when stocks declined at ~$160. If it falls again for some reason, I'll buy more. 

They are blasting on all cylinders. AWS is strong. Advertising is strong. 3rd party services is strong. All 3 are growing double digit revenue. 

Streaming is strong. Prime Video is 2nd biggest streamer in the world (competing with Disney+, Paramount+, Peacock...). They will soon have about 66 regular games stream on Prime (not all of them, sadly). This will improve Advertising. 

Project Kuiper is a long-term investment and quite exciting. I do wish/hope they use SpaceX to launch satellites because they will get there faster. But SpaceX competes with Blue Origin so...... doubt it. 

And their Health stuff looks interesting too. 

> GOOGL

I have owned for almost a decade now, and have  added my position last year. In December they released some amazing AI tools for Gemini 2.0, which really shows how close they are to ChatGPT. And they have announced plans for more releases in January too. the LLMs are all quite close to each other now (excluding OpenAI's O3 model which has not released yet). 

Amazingly, their Gemini is completely built on Google's TPUs. Which is great because these AI and LLMs are very expensive to run on compute. But Google's TPUs gives them an advantage in cost. So unlike OpenAI and Microsoft, Google is not paying for the Nvidia tax for a ~70% margin high premium product. Google has a cost advantage. 

Why does this matter even though the Big Tech have a lot of cash already? Well, Google is able to release their new AI tools like Gemini 2.0 Flash models at a *much* better price/performance compared to OpenAI. I think last I saw it was about 100x cheaper than OpenAI's O1 model for developers to use. That is a *huge* difference. 

I admit, I really underestimated Google in AI... I know they have invested in it for years, but that does not necessarily mean the results will follow. It appeared (to me) that they wanted to only rely on the Google Search moat and cashcow. Their Gemini 1.0 was quite lackluster, in my opinion. But with 2.0, wow. They really hit it out of the park! 

What else is in their AI? In December they released Deep Research which is really cool for researching whatever topics have your fancy. They released NotebookLM this year which is quite popular. They will soon release Google Veo2, which is for AI generated videos and is absolutely phenomenal, blowing Sora out of the water. Mark my words, ads we see on YouTube will soon be Auto-generated when you Click on the video by Veo2. Ads won't be custom made manually soon, they will be mostly (not 100%) AI generated based on your Google history. 

Also, they are soon releasing Project Astra, Project Mariner (AI Agents), Project Jules (for coding). 

And this doesn't even touch on Google Cloud which is growing very fast too. Since 2023, the Revenue is bigger than YouTube. The industry is big enough for the Big 3 Cloud providers globally. 

Plus, Search is still growing. It was 12% YoY growth in the last Quarter. And YouTube is growing ~12% too.

All the companies you mentioned are basically overvalued with the exception of AMZN. They are all great companies and constant-growers, but entering today in 4 out of 5 will result in short term losses, in my opinion. So AMZN yes, the other ones I would wait to enter. 

I am invested in two btw, AMZN and ASML. I am planning to sell the latter soon. To re-enter when is cheaper.

Some solid thoughts. Asml is the only one of the 5 mentioned that I don’t own at the moment. This is the “cheapest” I have seen it in a p/e basis. I am torn because I like monopoly like companies, but I also tend to avoid high p/e cyclical names. That said, some of the fears you mentioned around China appear to be priced after their pretty dramatic pull back. To believe is Asml is to believe that fab build outs have only just begun. Remember that these machines are $300-400 million each and the more they sell the more of that recurring revenue will grow.

The extent of my international exposure is in US multinational companies. Yes. These Chinese companies look cheap.

Well, Covid was a rare event. But yes, if there is economic deterioration, AXP will take a hit. There is cyclicality. Their focus on affluent consumers may shield them a bit, but I would perceive a pullback as a buying opportunity. The other threat to AXP could be changes to rules/laws about the credit card business. Trump has talked about this.

No problem. The US never had the infrastructure to refine their own production (they produce sweet crude, the US refineries refine sour crude imported elsewhere, to cut it short this is basically because way back US mostly produced sour crude but it’s ran out, through fracking the Us produces sweet crude but refineries aren’t built for that so US exports it) 

The bull thesis really assumes 1. Energy transition will take longer 2. Reserves will last for a while (not run out) in North America and 3. Trump may be a catalyst to increase production (hence demand for fracking services) while also not causing oil and gas companies to lose money at lower prices, one way is lower price but higher volume so bottom line is the same. So incentivize oil and gas companies in the US to produce more trump is likely to further increase tax breaks and subsidies etc for oil and gas companies. Best case for me is after trump gets in office, the moment he introduces favourable tax or other policies for oil and gas companies there may be a pop (not priced in because so far oil and gas companies still trading within the range during biden years so any “trump premium” probably isn’t priced in and/or the whole energy transition thing is pressuring stocks down) 

In the near term it’s only #3 that’s driving my thesis. The first two is either you believe it or not, there’s plenty of biased “data” to support both sides

Oh haha that’s great. GD and HII are my picks, honestly I need to look at other stocks more. 

Also need to better understand current US naval planned buildup. 

Chinas naval buildup is accelerating (new flat tops etc coming online all the time) but I have a hard time understanding how much of chinas buildup has been anticipated (and hence already countered) by pentagons existing plans, since it’s only the unexpected “delta” that will drive a near term “pop” . 

If you don’t want to rely on a pop (eg: just long stock rather than dated calls) then just buy and hold should be fine. But with buy and hold it’s hard to justify thats the “most optimal” position since there’s always opportunity cost . So from the opportunity cost perspective I put a lot more in lbrt since I think shorter term the catalyst for that will happen first. 

Wish I had more data or insights but that’s all I’ve got for now…

I guess you could argue it's fairly valued and that it will give you a somewhat safe 10% return which is ok. With the risk that any multiple compression will hurt it. Not really my type of stock but I can see the theory.

This sub is called value investing and if you take a look over a 5 year period a lot of growth is already priced in US stocks, China on the other hand has incredible growth stocks trading at a PE of 10.

> To believe is Asml is to believe that fab build outs have only just begun


Was just looking into this more. EUV is not used for all chips. But here are some of the chips they are used for: 

* High Performance Compute (HPC) Processors for CPUs from Intel and AMD for desktop, servers, and data centers 

* High end GPUs from Nvidia and AMD for gaming, AI, and data centers 

* Mobile chips used in flagship phones like Apple, Samsung, and Google pixel. 

* Advanced Memory for DRAM. 

I know the chip industry is cyclical. But for a long-term investor, these technologies are not going away. Even for use cases where EUV is not needed right now, in the future this may change. 

But either way, all of these use cases have high demand and will continue to do so going forward. 

Edit: oh and another factor. Countries like Japan, Saudi Arabia, and India have expressed plans for chip manufacturing expansion. 

I *think* this will involve the need for ASML EUV machines, assuming these countries will develop the cutting edge chips.

No I do understand. But for some of us it feels ‘safer’ to invest 500-1500 in a specific stock. So in this case I’d buy 1 to 3. 

Whereas with (for example) Intel I’d buy more stocks but would never spend more than 600/700

Most fair price calcs don’t account or do a bad job of valuing the premium deserved for many companies. Nike is one of 3 internationally recognizable clothing brands and the only ‘affordable’ one. If you compare its average P/E it has a value similar to in 2015 so you can probably add a good % premium on the price

Tesla at it current price is a deep discount IMO. 

I think Tesla will more than double in price in the next few years. 

Why the Trump relationship is important: 11 different alphabet agencies have been investigating his companies. That ends Day 1. From there we are looking at deep regulation cuts that will be beneficial to autonomous driving.

Waymo’s are ugly, clunky, can’t drive on freeways, and only available in select cities. Tesla is going to dominate the market with FSD, some estimates for their FSD technology puts them at 5 trillion valuation. Just think about how much money they’d make if they licensed it to other companies.

Humanoid robots: They’re out….sorta. There’s 2 of them in Tesla’s factory performing basic tasks. I think in the next few years that we’ll see one following Trump around and giving free advertisement. Not sure when they’ll enter mass production but I’m a long term holder of Tesla so I don’t care. I think the humanoid robot will boost their value over the $10 trillion mark. We shall see. 

They’re only valued at 1.5 trillion today. I believe it’s going to at least double in value in the next year. Making this a “value” play. 


PS: I never even mentioned their energy technology which I’m also very bullish on…or the fact they own the only lithium refinery in the states.

The risk to buying Chinese equities is the political decisions made by the CCP. They give me the impression that the policy changes can be made at will by Xi Jinping. This alone is a deterrent to investing in Chinese equities.

> Why the Trump relationship is important: 11 different alphabet agencies have been investigating his companies. That ends Day 1

Why is his companies being investigated? and are they valid reasons? 

> Waymo’s are ugly, clunky, can’t drive on freeways, and only available in select cities

Waymo's have been seen recently on highways in San Francisco. And are expanding in major cities pretty quickly. I could see them licensing the tech to major companies as well, given that a number of car companies have and are starting to get Android Automotive OS (different from Android Auto). It's like they're set up to receive Waymo as opposed to Tesla's FSD. 

Also, Waymo has L4 Autonomous Driving because no human driver needed and can not drive everywhere but only in Geofenced areas. 

Tesla is still L2 because a human driver is needed and must remain alert. 

> some estimates for their FSD technology puts them at 5 trillion valuation.

C'mon man. $5T is more than the valuation of Meta and Google *combined*. Even a number of people with a Tesla now are not buying the subscription for FSD because understandably, it is quite a premium product (expensive). What's the path to $5T that you are seeing? Because I don't see Elon giving up his FSD to rival car companies. If people could buy a Kia to use the FSD they will not buy a Tesla. Meaning significant lost revenue and profit. 

I guess I should ask *when* do you see it hitting $5T? If you mean 10-20 years from now, I could believe that...

MSTR: leading financial institution in bitcoin. If Bitcoin gets widely adopted they will be the top bitcoin bank in the world. Also the highest gaining asset of 2024. 

Tesla: about to take over the ridesharing industry with Full Self Drive. They’re about to enter the Indian market. They have humanoid robots on the way. They have the only lithium refinery in the states. 1.5 trillion seems rather low. Also own 4k bitcoins. Every major institution holds a buy rating and are expecting the stock to double within the next few years. 

Joby and Archer are purely speculative plays because I think they’re fun companies that have a lot of potential. 


You have zero input and are kind of an idiot if you don’t see the value of Microstrategy and Tesla.

Dude put it next to Tesla and MSTR and some trashcoins. 

His investment picks are nothing but speculation. AMD and NVDA shouldn't be in his portfolio...

NVDA is pretty fairly valued, I think. I have an ITM call on it, and it's the only call I have as I think it can easily climb again following this quarters ER after being stagnant since June. Valuations are catching up to the price giving it a pretty nice base.

AMD is getting cheap as well. 

This whole chip sector will get absolutely crushed though if we wind up in a chip commodity glut. Sales and margins dive on top of the large valuations ignoring that risk. Point being, it's far from a huge sector of my portfolio, as I'm aware of the cyclical nature. I'd rather pick em up in a large glut.

New to value investing but reading A LOT to catch up. You believe that NVDA has plenty of room to climb?  I first invested in stocks in 1999 and bought all tech. Thought I was rich for a few months until the bubble burst! Learned some valuable lessons. Interesting to see so many here have NVDA on their list so perhaps I need to take another look at this sector.

Comment by Imnewtoallthis at 2025-01-05 01:04:38+00:00:
NVDA is not a "value" investment.  It is a "growth" equity.  

By definition a value investment is Value investing is a strategy that involves buying assets that are trading at a lower price than their intrinsic value. The goal is to find assets that the market has mispriced, and to invest in companies that are likely to be overlooked or underpriced. 
Value stocks have low P/E, P/B, high dividend, and slow growth.
Growth stocks on the other hand, have HIGH P/E,  no dividend, and high/quick growth

Nvidia is definitely not overlooked or underpriced.  This is the wrong sub for you, check out /stocks or /wallstbets.

Value investing is meant to preach the principles from Ben Graham's "intelligent Investor" or Warren Buffet (who owns no Nvidia)

Comment by FACOSERO at 2025-01-05 00:44:36+00:00:

When the Dot Com Bubble was happening, investors were investing in companies with zero profits. They invested based on how many clicks they had, and "potential revenue". 

Companies like Nvidia have actually profit, with ~80% gross margin. 

So it's not really the same thing. 

Doesn't mean a company like Nvidia can't be overpriced. Just that it's not the same thing.

Microstrategy owns about 2.25% of the bitcoin supply making my them the largest public hodler of bitcoin. They own $40 billion in bitcoin. When the price of a single bitcoin is 1 million a coin, they will have $400 billion in value.

Do you understand?

Yes, that's exactly what "value investing" is.  That's what this subreddit is all about.  You come here talking about Nvidia and Crypto is like going over to /r/bogleheads and telling them to invest in a single equity instead of VTSAX or VOO.  It's not that Nvidia and Crypto aren't generating a return for you, it's just not what the strategy of the subreddit you're commenting is about.

Comment by MrChucklz at 2025-01-06 02:40:05+00:00:
Well you’re looking at a hybrid which isn’t the same as an EV. 

Anyways, I just went down a rabbit hole looking at KIA’s that qualify for it and not many KIA’s actually do qualify for the rebate. I don’t see any hybrids that do qualify. And of the EVs that do, apparently depending on what manufacturing plant they come out of, they won’t even qualify. Regardless, the rebates ending soon.

Anyway $5 trillion valuation is for the FSD technology that is about to create a huge market (cyber cab, and that bus) and having the largest and one of the few in country lithium refineries. It’s not going to be $5 trillion overnight. It’s going to take time to reach that valuation but it’s going there. Even if they don’t license their FSD to other companies it won’t matter. 

Tesla has mastered mass manufacturing and they will continue to deliver their products cheaper and cheaper and they won’t have anyone to compete with. They’re rumored to be releasing a new vehicle valued at 30k. 

They also have a very big opportunity to expand internationally with the Trump and Elon bromance. IIRC India is going to be the next big market they penetrate. 

I haven’t even mentioned energy storage and their rapidly growing solar panel projects. I haven’t mentioned Optimus. I haven’t mentioned that the federal highway system designated Tesla as the standard for EV charging. Haven’t mentioned the fact that they have the largest charging network that every single EV charges at. Haven’t mentioned that FSD is going live in China this year either. Haven’t mentioned that they have 5k bitcoin on the balance sheet. Haven’t mentioned the regulations and tax cuts. 

Tesla is going to $5 trillion dollars. It will become the most valuable publicly traded company within the next decade.  

You mentioned it being worth more than Apple? If Tesla wanted to, they could create a Tesla phone tomorrow and eat Apple. Remember when Apple partnered with Hyundai and tried to make an Apple car to compete with Tesla?? Billions of RnD with no product to even show. I’m pretty sure Elon reminded Tim Cook of that fact and that’s why he’s been playing nice on X and with President Trump. 

Time will tell. Please challenge my assumptions. I’d love to hear input from someone who disagrees. But please don’t tell me I should steer clear of Tesla stock because Kia exists lmao

He can keep his ego, I'll keep my money. I didn't even say i was against holding MSTR, I just said it was high risk.

Tesla is just a dreamer stock and has been for years. People called you dumb back in 2000 too, I'm sure if you weren't all in dot com names.  Tesla is a dot come valuation. Bitcoin doesn't have any intrinsic value, although it's being adopted more and more, which gives it a value. But it could just be another bubble too and will be talked about in history books as the greatest ponzi scheme.

I was in college during dot com. I went on to do med school and residency and fellowship - so there was a looong stretch of not investing other than in the TSP. Got out a few years ago and started with a wealth management company. Read many books and realized they were fine at helping me start investing but now I believe I can do better than them using index funds with much lower expense ratios!  So in the process of making that transition. In the meantime, as I’m always curious, I asked ChatGPT how I could learn how to invest like Buffet or Munger (seems to have worked for Pabrai!). That led down a rabbit hole of books and videos and podcasts I’ve been consuming. So here I am…money invested in the markets but always managed for me, trying to figure out how to do a better job of it and not end up like some of the people on wallstbets with a negative balance after margin calls!!

Bitcoin is currently being used as a store of value. There’s a very finite supply of bitcoin and soon most nations will be fighting to own some. I’ve been buying since 2017 at around 15k a coin. 


What has it done for me?

Well in the last 4 years my wealth wasn’t obliterated when they turned on the printers. So you can say I’ve used it as a hedge against inflation. There’s too many benefits to using bitcoin and I won’t get into all of them on this subreddit.

My point is that Bitcoin is going to rocket in price when we move to the Bitcoin standard and that MSTR stands to become one of the worlds biggest financial institutions. At $80 billion in market cap while they own $40 billion in bitcoin makes them highly undervalued for me. It’s the reason they were the best performing stock of 2024 and i think 2025 will be similar.

Title: Is Google and Amazon a buy today?

The SCOTUS appears very likely to uphold the law banning TikTok. The ban will go into effect on the 19th of this month.

GOOGL and META are the only real alternatives to TikTok (through Youtube Shorts for the former and Instagram and Facebook Reels for the latter).

GOOGL is already the most undervalued - it's definitely a buy in my opinion.

Google price makes zero sense to me:

1. Waymo is valued at 50b tesla is valued at 1.6T
2. TPU's are valued at 0, nvidia is valued at 3.6T
3. Google is worth less than the market on a p/e, despite growing significantly faster.
4. Youtube is the largest media asset in the world by far.
5. Cloud is growing faster than AWS or Azure
6. Verily/Isomorphic labs have the potential to be 500b assets alone.

IDK I just feel like as individual companies the individual non-search parts of google are a 1.5-2T company already. and you get like 130B of cash with that.

And search is still growing at like 10-13% .

I didn't buy facebook at 80 when i felt the same way and feel awful for it, so i'm long google by an irrational amount.

One of two thing seem true to me: The market is in a bubble and googles not, or googles massively undervalued.

Comment by Purrlow at 2025-01-11 22:15:16+00:00:
Google and Amazon seem pretty solid especially long term. You’re getting way more than just search and a retail business. MSFT is probably not a bad option too. However, it is more richly priced than google or Amazon and comes with less growth potential. There is a possibility MSFT gets TikTok but no idea how likely that is. Outside of that I think google and Amazon offer a bit more long term. 

AMD is still in a downward spiral who knows when it breaks out. Could be tomorrow, 6 months from now or even longer. Personally I’m staying away unless it dips below 100 or has some strong news momentum and then I would probably have a plan in place to sell once it runs a little. It’s been the hot stock to talk about recently because 2024 was so bad. But there has been nothing to indicate 2025 will be better, especially the first half. From a news stand point think the public is looking for more AI connection than has been put forth. And long term I think there are better semi plays. (Don’t think it’s a bargain at 115 atm)

I’ve been adding to GOOG and AMZN the last 5 months consistently.  I will be adding consistently trying to build each position to about 7-10% of my individual portfolio picks.  

BN is another holding that I have about 9% in at the moment.  Cost basis is sub $50 CAD

I have NVDA too if we’re only debating Mag7.

“These stocks have dropped a bit but I don’t feel like they will have the same correction as the rest of the market as they are such big market stocks that don’t see much volatility. Therefore this makes me believe this is an okay price.”

This is never a good reason to buy any company. 

Also, you could argue that their business is not volatile, but certainly the stock price is. Amazon for example dropped over 50% from an all time high fairly recently. Google dropped 40% percent at the same time. 

That being said, I prefer google

While these are great companies, I'd suggest looking deeper than just relative price movements or comparisons between tech stocks. I focus on analyzing fundamentals like profitability trends, cash flows, and debt levels rather than just price action.

For long-term value investing, I've found it helpful to have specific criteria for what makes a stock "undervalued" - that's actually why I built valu8.app. It sends weekly alerts when companies meet certain fundamental metrics I care about (profitability ratios, growth sustainability, etc.).

Plenty of catalysts for Amazon the month/years to come, the reputation of the company to rollout operational excellence is priced-in. It's expensive and will likely remains so. I grabbed couple of my shares on Friday and will continue to do so if it drop under 220 again.

For me, the narrative for GOOGL is a bit different, asides their antitrust issues, their core cashcow is impacted by AI and it difficult to gauge to which extend their business will be impacted.

Even if they do have as much catalysts as AMZN today, they often missed the mark in the past while being in the same situation. The company doesn't have the same track-record of deploying ruthless operations, still, I feel that Sundar Pichai has been particularly strong last year. He appears more like a war-type CEO so let's see. I am also grabbing couple shares while remaining cautious.

Amazon and Google both look decent long term investments. Nobody knows when the right time to buy shares is but best to buy some then wait. Try buy on down days for the market and dont buy all at once. Try to average your price down. Dont buy all at once in case you buy one week and then the market corrects 10% or so. Also Sofi looks a great buy currently. Earnings coming up in a few weeks and they tent to beat earnings and raise guidance. A well run company with huge growth this one will go much higher this year....

Comment by Teembeau at 2025-01-12 03:21:07+00:00:
Maybe these are personal opinions about their products but they influence how I think about stocks.

Google - more and more I don't use Google because there are certain places that have specific types of data and they now have very good searches. Like if I want to know about products I go searching reddit. If I want general encyclopedia type information i go to Wikipedia. I find OpenTable or trip advisor more useful for restaurants. And I've made an instinctive leap. I used to search on Google and then be "oh, look at this garbage, of course I should use OpenTable" and now, I just go straight to OpenTable. So I struggle to feel confident that Google are going to be this mighty force they once were.

Amazon - I work in software, on the periphery of cloud and I'm very sceptical about the growth in cloud and how long it can keep growing. Also, in terms of both cloud and selling of goods, I just feel like Alibaba is not only growing in China but is going to come for Amazon's business. Like if I want something and don't mind waiting a fortnight, I buy from Alibaba. But I think they're going to set up more European warehouses and you order from China, fulfilled from the USA. They also have Alibaba Cloud.

Mag 7 companies at any price are good for the long term unless something catastrophic happens. They only go up aside from minor dips.

But short term is more risky as we see the last week, most companies fell a few % and some a lot (tesla).

I would recommend waiting till after earnings in 3 weeks to see if the stocks rally or not.

Also long term i would throw palantir and broadcom in there as your choices.

I see broadcom by 300 usd at the end of the year, and if palantir continues at this rate it will be likely be the next member of the elite and make mag 8. 

You are entering investing at a wonderful time. Like the time just as the internet launched.

Reddit and Spotify are both looking to take on YouTube. 

In the Reddit app you can click the drop down at the top and go to „watch“. Reddit has been doing panning on allowing individual contributors to monetize, which will increase content. 

So I think those two would benefit, though they are both in the early stages. But both are looking to add monetization for content creators this year

The only difference I see is that the sentiment was really bad with Meta at the time whereas everybody seems kind of bullish on Google, so the low valuation doesn’t make sense..

I own Google and really like the business and Waymo. 

But have not figured out how much Revenue they may get from Waymo as it grows. I mean, their TTM for GCP is about ~$40B. 

Also, not sure what profit margin may come from Waymo because those cars aren't cheap. Plus the insurance and maintenance, etc. 

So Waymo is still a wait-and-see for me. 

But I still like how everything else is doing.

1. Waymo is valued at 50b tesla is valued at 1.6T

I think tesla is valued more because of the data and the actual AI reasoning of it, Waymo does do good self-driving but through careful city planning and intricate sensors while Tesla has a really honestly revolutionary way of transforming camera input into a coherent vector-space, kinda makes the whole world around it into a video-game and making robots in video-games is really easy to do, think character rigging or self-driving in cyberpunk, the main issue self-driving systems have is the representation of the world and the massive data and engineering Tesla has behind that really is worth a lot to me.

I mean that's not to say I think it should have this current valuation idk how much it really is worth but people calling Tesla's robotics stupid or behind the times and Tesla's self-driving as empty stupid promises are also out of touch imo, but yeah I just think a lot of their strengths are not apparent to many people, not to mention if all cars go electric (looking pretty likely tbh especially with BYD moving up in the world that's not the US) they control the single biggest reliable charging network ever, think of how much a company that controls every gas station would be worth you know idk, I do think it should be worth more than most car companies, maybe not 1.6T but they do have real value people ignore idk.

I only own Google; I don't particularly like Meta as a company and I am not interested in copying the entire Mag 7. 

That said, looking at each objectively I find it hard to say one is a better choice than the other. I believe Meta will benefit from TikTok's ban *more* based on Instagram's already significant popularity and Facebook Reels' superior algorithms. Youtube Shorts benefit from being on YouTube itself, but the algorithm is awful. That said, Google will still benefit enormously.

With Google more undervalued but likely to benefit slightly less I'd call the choice a wash. I don't like Zuckerberg so my ultimate deciding factor was a personal one - I only let personal views in when I (1) simply won't put money into a particular industry on principle or (2) have a choice where fundamentals and context are making a final decision difficult. In this case, the latter led me to invest in Google.

Thing is that Google are probably the biggest ad network experts out there. Even if search stops existing and is replaced by a new LLM style “search” - an optimist could argue that they are the best set to insert ads there. Of course, maybe ads in that world never take off / are AS profitable (but i find it a bit hard to believe)

Comment by redRabbitRumrunner at 2025-01-12 15:26:09+00:00:
Yes. They will have to spend a lot of capital in an arms race to ensure their cash cow ‘search’ remains viable. People are starting to change behavior and use ChatGpt and perplexity for what otherwise would have been search. Death of a monopoly wil lead to margin erosion, subsequently further domino effect. Search is already degraded as Google pursues AI

However, Google is a dominant company and if focused should be able to stay in the to 3.

Google has the second largest share buy back scheme with over 12% less shares afloat than 5 years ago. Combined with its expected 0.8% dividend it's actually a very favourable deal for a growth stock. Conversely Amazon has added to its total float which is one of the reasons I don't invest in it.

People don’t just search for information They search for product tickets hotels businesses etc. Google has YouTube , Google Maps ,Mail ,Waymo ,Wise and Google search and can monetize them all. It will take open ai or someone else a long time to catch up to all these connections. Hopefully Google will not stay still with the lead they have 
Currently They can easily disrupt the hotel and ticketing industry itself

Here's what Claude says and I kind of agree "While it’s technically possible to inject ads into LLM responses through training or post-processing, this would likely be a risky business strategy. Ads could seriously damage user trust and the core value of LLMs, which people rely on for accurate, unbiased information and complex tasks. Instead of direct advertising, companies like Google would likely find more success with alternative monetization strategies like premium API tiers or using LLMs to enhance their existing ad platforms, rather than compromising the AI’s reliability with embedded ads."

I made this comment higher, but for me, Google is getting replaced by platform-specific searches. Like instead of going to google and looking for a Japanese restaurant in a town, I hit Tripadvisor or OpenTable, where I can not only specify type of cuisine, location but also price range and other things. Or if I want to know about a movie I go straight to Letterboxd. It gives better search results and avoids all of that garbage news content.

There is so much old media garbage clickbait on the internet that is optimised for how Google works and it's making it unusable for most things.

SBC reduces earnings so it is factored in in your price earnings ratio. Some companies do this meme and create adjusted earnings number where they add back SBC.

FCF doesn't consider SBC as it is a non cash charge but is obviously a real cost to shareholders. If you want to do a sensible DCF you should remove SBC from your free cash flow numbers.

Well it can happen of course but it doesnt happen that much. In general companies have to be very profitable to be buying back their own shares. If you look at Warren Buffet his company Berkshire Hathaway have bought back a huge amount of shares and have been huge beneficieries off apples massive share buybacks. in general there preferable to dividends which are taxable.

SBC is factored into expenses on the earnings statement. The P/E ratio already takes into account SBC. The net earnings you see already have SBC subtracted out as part of the operating expenses. The guy is just wrong. This is how GAAP works and Google only reports GAAP earnings, they don't report bullshit like 'adjusted earnings or EBIDTA'

Comment by Raendor at 2025-01-13 20:22:38+00:00:
Claims not going to beat the market -> proceeds to  allocating to tech etf and individual tech stocks

Do it simple. Pick your vti/vxus or vt and if you still want to pick some individual names - leave no more than 10% in it for play. But I bet if you do the latter - you’ll end up babysitting that 10% all the time.

If you're going to stop trying to beat the market, I would go all in on that approach and stop trying to get alpha with your GOOGL, AMZN, and NVDA holdings. Depending on your age, I'd either go 100% VT, or a three-fund Boglehead-style portfolio.

You can’t say you realized you won’t beat the market then put 50% of your portfolio into 3 stocks and the other 50% in ETFs that have massive weightings of those same three stocks. By my napkin math you have about 60% of your investment in 3 stocks. That’s hardly realizing you can’t beat the market.

NVDA, GOOGL/GOOG, and AMZN combined comprise like 20% of SCHG/QQM and 10%ish of VOO. 

You have created a portfolio where three companies are 60% of your portfolio only you also get to pay fees for a couple of etfs to manage like 10% of that 60%.

Nothing against a bit of concentration personally (Warren Buffet has a highly concentrated portfolio) but it's a strategy for beating the market, not relax and chill. I also have a contrarian opinion on Nvidia. I think the o3 and DeepSeek breakthroughs at the end of last year will have long running implications for chip demand. Specifically, training is becoming cheap and inference is becoming expensive. Nvidia's rivals are much more competitive when it comes to inference.

Also, the idea that ever larger training datasets lead to ever greater performance seems to be dead in the water. Nobody is talking about gpt-6 scale models any more. That can't be good for Nvidia.

I think if you have conviction in your picks, then go for it. However it is very tech tilted, and that is fine if you believe that tech will continue to perform. Perhaps an idea to explore could be VOO/VGT combo or VOO/SCHG/VGT combo. I personally have SCHG/VGT and NVIDIA amongst a few others, so I am biased towards tech. Time will tell how this plays out.

This is a Value Investing vs Boglehead debate. Here is Ted W from BRK comparing his IRA returns:

According to a public statement issued by Ted Weschler, over the course of 28 years he grew an initial Roth IRA account balance of $70k into $131M. This increase implies a 31% annual return on investment. Such increases were made exclusively through the purchase of publicly available securities and are indicative of long-term market outperformance. He said that if his $70k in savings at the end of 1989 had been parked in Vanguard’s S&P 500 index fund, it would be worth about $1.6 million as of June 30, 2021 — a roughly 23-times gain.

Comment by Regular-Proposal-437 at 2025-01-14 00:38:53+00:00:
If you look through 13F filings for wealth managers you can see how fund managers diversify. Many have portfolio with ETF holdings structured and weighted something similar to this for growth & chill:

IWF (Russel 1000 Growth) 25%
IWD (Russel 1000 value) 25%
IWS (Russel MDCP value) 20%
IWP (Russel MDCP growth) 20%
IWN (Russel 2000 value) 10%

Vanguard has similar offerings as the BlackRock ishares mentioned above.

This is a contrarian opinion I have but I think if you ACTUALLY hold for 30 years you’ll be fine except for maybe nvidia, people say growth doesn’t outperform the market but every 30 years there’s this huge surge of growth stocks going up in the triple digits of percentage points I mean if you bought AMZN during the peak frenzy of the internet bubble you’d be fine now so I actually think you’re fine but the fact you made these picks specifically kinda tells me you don’t actually have the discipline to hold this for 30 years and will sell on the first bear signs though tbh, have some better hedging for tech risk

I believe in not keeping more tickers than you can handle so I assume when you say this is simplified you have had more sprawl in the past. 

Anytime you diverge from S&P it is because you want to beat the S&P (or you are older and want to hedge for retirement). Most will not beat the market hence most people “want” to beat the market by diverging from S&P and end up not beating the market via their results. 

You can back test your portfolio and see where you may have beat S&P with your current allocation here https://testfol.io/ using the magic of hindsight 20/20.  Just keep in mind that hindsight 20/20 means little for the future. 

If you are truly confident in your abilities having a custom allocation of Mag 7 is not a bad way to go in trying to beat S&P but you better have some analysis and a good deal of luck on this as well. 

I’ve beaten S&P for past few years in my largest portfolios.  And I have a tech oriented mix of mag7 as well as other niche plays.  But I keep up to date with tech news since it’s always a hobby of mine anyways and it’s definitely not growth and chill but constant monitoring and decisions on rebalancing. 

Some examples of where I buy and sell mag7 stocks. Obviously buying Nvda when it was cheaper for AI boom, but selling positions as hardware performance walls loom.  Buying Google during overblown sell off due to anti trust news. Selling Meta when Facebook was doing nothing for a long time. Buying meta when Facebook just turned on their annoying ad spam to 11 and generating a surprise upside.  Selling meta again after realizing the ad revenue of their annoying Facebook ad spam is priced in and realizing they are back at doing not much besides their lofty VR headset/universe dreams or and realizing Zuckerberg has jumped the shark and is becoming much like Elon.  It is alright to dabble in mag 7 custom allocation if you feel you are in the know enough about one being over or underweight in value. 

I find making rebalance moves “fun” and I’ve been beating S&P consistently enough to not go full blown boglehead. But I keep myself humbled enough and knowing that my luck could run out so that my stock choices aren’t full tilt speculation like MSTR lol. 

Btw I think tech heavy was the way to go in the most recent rally since 23 but I don’t know where it goes tomorrow.  My current portfolio hasn’t made up its mind yet as it’s a mix of significant bonds plus tech.  It’s definitely not chill though. Last trades I’ve done was selling CEG on the day it went up 20% before it fell back to earth 8% today.  If keeping track of this stuff on the daily seems like a waste of time to you stick to indexes.

Comment by Shmigleebeebop at 2025-01-14 05:05:34+00:00:
Just buy the s&p. That doesn’t mean you’re a bad investor, it means you’re smart. Or buy the S&P plus 1 or 2 of your favorite names as a small percentage of your portfolio. If you’re good at trading (you may not be) you can sell when the market is over bought and buy more beta when it’s over sold. The thing about the s&p is it contains so much of the market that you’re going to capture all the industries that are growing better than the market this year. As a company or industry out performs it becomes a larger chunk of the s&p and therefore you’re benefiting from it. You never have to worry about “missing out”.

You just bought a ton of stocks based on recency bias which tells me yu may be pretty new. Almost 40% of your stocks are 2 companies. You're not really taking the ETF "not try to beat the market" route. You wouldn't be buying Nvidia and amazon that high if so as close to half your entire portfolio. You also wouldn't be balls deep into one sector so heavily. If you truly aren't trying it beat the market change this to VOO and a bit of VXUS. You could go 80/20. 

Otherwise, you are just trying to gamble and not looking at 30+ year numbers and instead just recency bias.

Comment by Financial_Counter_08 at 2025-01-14 11:04:16+00:00:
This post bothers me, not enough to actually bother me, but enough to write this post.  
  
You become rich when you wake up with a good idea and instead stay focused on your long term plan. I think you woke up with this nice idea, got bored of whatever you were doing, and made this. Now you are imagining not changing it no matter what for 30 years, but the sort of person that does this is the sort of person to change what they are doing often.

The portfolio reaks of over thinking. If you are going with the '30-year and not try to beat the market approach', BUY THE S&P500, why 2 other funds and extra big tech? The point of an index fund is to diversify. You don't need funds of funds.

Also, 17.65% NVIDIA? Nvidia is not a value play. It's not on offer, they dont have a long history of beating earnings expectations, only a recent one. On top of this everyone who wants to start their own chatgpt has already done so. META have their huge AI servers, Microsoft theirs, Google theirs, even Tesla has theirs, and cant forget twitter (sorry X) has theirs. I'm sure they will all buy more chips, but these companies would be bad INVESTORS if they all needed new data centers literally 2 years after spending BILLIONS on their current ones.

Comment by collinspeight at 2025-01-13 20:38:16+00:00:
GOOGL, AMZN, and NVDA already have significant allocations in QQQM, VOO, and SCHG. The extra diversification you get from the ETFs that isn't allocated to those holdings is minimal. If the tech sector takes a dive, that small amount of extra diversification is not saving you, so why not just go 100% QQQM if you're that bullish on tech? That seems simpler and more diversified to me than what you have, although that route seems incredibly risky.
----------------------------------------
Comment by DylanIE_ at 2025-01-14 07:43:20+00:00:
So why not just get rid of all the ETFs and just buy the mag 7, a bunch of AI, Quantum etc. and try to outperform the market? That's already what you're trying to do....?

All 3 of your "picks" have significant exposure in every etf that you mentioned. Adding them on separately doesn't actually do anything for you. If you want alpha why not try to pick a smaller company that is undervalued? Getting a 100% return on a $2B company is a whole lot easier than a $2T company.

Bashing Nvidia because you think it isn't a value stock, shows your lack of understanding of what value is.

A company can be 35-40 PE (Apple) and be expensive, a company can be 40-50 PE (Nvidia and Amazon) and still be a better value proposition based on their revenue and net earnings trajectory.

At your age I think you’re best off going 50/50 in VOO/QQQM based on what you’ve said. I like VGT as an alternative to QQQM as well.

I would suggest your “real” money goes into that split and you create a smaller “play” account where you pick stocks for the entertainment value. If you’re following this stuff closely, you are going to want to pick stocks, so having a dedicated account set up for that makes it easier and less tempting to start moving large amounts of money around when you probably shouldn’t.

80/20. Keep 80% in the index account and 20% in the stock picking account. Just my 2 cents. Good luck!

The problem is, is the best advice usually the dullest.. 
Everyone knows that we should all voo and chill. But we don't. Why? Because it's fucking boring watching it for 30 years.  We'd rather gamble with our futures, so we pick single stocks instead of just doing what we all really should.  ETFS, for the best part, are the gateway drug to single stock picking.

He said it was a 30 year portfolio. For shits and giggles I pulled the three companies that are in the same market cap position for 1995 (2, 4, and 5) as NVDA, GOOG, and AMZN are now. Coca Cola, Bank of America, and Raytheon held those spots in 1995. 

Coke: 13.3 in 1995. 61.63 today = 4.6x

BOA: 11.66 in 1995. 45.05 today = 3.85x

Raytheon: 5.08 in 1995. 117.5 today = 23.12x 

AVG return: 10.52x

S&P 500: 459.27 in 1995. 5,836 today = 12.7x

1. A single highly developed country who’s market capitalization is more than 50% of the world 

2. The rest of the world, trading at half the valuation

NVDA is the poster child of a growth stock, not value. 

It pays no dividend, it has meteoric growth and the stock valuation is premised on their future prospects, which are base on speculation.

If you read the intelligent investors, or look at the holdings of people based on that brand of investment philosophy (e.g. Klarnan, Buffet, Marks, Burry) you will see that none of them hold it. 

I think you are more confused that I am, say is PLTR real value though?

You've been downvoted, but you are actually right.

Buffet always said it's better to get a great company at a reasonable price than it is an average company at a good price..I'm not talking about APPLE OR NIVDIA  here but just in general.  

  Just because a company is cheap now doesn't mean it's good value, and just because a company is expensive doesn't mean it's not a value stock.. Most people think value = cheap.

It's not value when all of it currently is speculation. You can't point to any numbers that actually show it's undervalued by actual numbers. You're just speculating. You can't point to any of the top value investors methodology or even basic fundamentals and show it as value. Stop. Nothing worse than people on a sub that don't even know what value investing even means trying to explain shit. 

If you want to buy a stock cool, but don't claim it as value investing when it ain't.

Comment by DylanIE_ at 2025-01-14 11:17:31+00:00:
What? Speculation? Then everything is speculation. Even US treasuries are speculation because you assume they won't default.

What do you use to see if something is undervalued? Low P/E? Low P/B? Sometimes these are low because the stock is garbage. As I said, would you buy Nvidia for $100 for the entire company? It's a simple question. If you would, it implies you think it's undervalued, I.e. the definition of value investing. 

>Nothing worse than people on a sub that don't even know what value investing even means trying to explain shit. 

Nothing worse than people on this sub thinking value investing is buying single digit P/Es and then acting like they're a great value investor. I think it is you that needs to stop explaining shit.

Inverse r/ValueInvesting needs to be a fund and I'm sure it would perform extraordinarily great because most people here think dividends are free money and dying companies with garbage products that trade at under 10 P/E are great investments because they're "so cheap".
----------------------------------------
Comment by DylanIE_ at 2025-01-14 08:00:22+00:00:
The Nasdaq has a significantly higher volatility, so you're not actually getting "additional returns". If you get double the returns but double your volatility, your alpha is 0.

Additionally, since January of 2000, QQQ and SPY have almost identical total returns: 543% for SPY vs 551% for QQQ. Yet as mentioned, QQQ brings on more volatility. So in reality, since 2000, QQQ has underperformed the SP500 by quite a large margin.

Comment by analbuttlick at 2024-12-29 16:32:45+00:00:
GOOGL - I bought first at 80, then 120, 150, 160. Avg price 130. I would buy more if it went down to 160. I feel its fairly valued now. 

TSLA - I would consider buying below 100, which would put the value around 300B. Which is still a lot for a car company, but would consider if they start making money other places than cars

MSFT - I would buy at a price to free cash flow of 30. Just because they have such a strong moat. Its currently at 44 tho, so it would have to drop to 300 in share price. 

AMZN - i bought at 100 and have just held. I will add if it dips below 2T valuation again. Its just a strong compounder. 

APPL - fuck them. They are throwing 100B annually buying back less than 3% of their outstanding shares at a PE of 40. If there was a good way to waste money, it’s spending all your operating income to buy back 3% of outstanding shares. It’s absolutely ridiculous. Would not touch below 20 PE

Comment by ManekenkaDaBudem at 2024-12-29 16:10:01+00:00:

Comment by LegitSalsa at 2024-12-29 23:59:17+00:00:
If you're approaching this from a value investing perspective, you should ignore all these comments naming prices but don't mention valuation.  

Figure out an intrinsic value estimate for each company. Simpler is better in this case, not something like a DFC. Then buy when you have a margin of safety (stock is trading for cheaper than your intrinsic value estimation).

I'd buy GOOGL closer to a PE of 20 and MSFT at some FCF multiple, not sure what. The rest I wouldn't buy unless they're dirt cheap (eg when Meta was trading for almost net cash or Apple at 10x earnings) just because of circle of competence/specific things I avoid.
----------------------------------------
Comment by Teembeau at 2024-12-29 17:11:54+00:00:
GOOGL. I think they're probably at about fair value

TSLA. $100 is absolute top price I'd pay. That's real value + reasonable growth. And I'm sceptical about the growth aspect as BYD are as big or close to being as big and everyone seems to rate their cars better. BMW are outselling Tesla on EVs in Europe. I'd probably start thinking about value in detail if they got near $100.

MSFT. Overpriced. Worth maybe $300. But I'm very sceptical about cloud growth and what is actually driving it (glad to share more details but it takes a while).

Meta. I feel something around fair to slightly overpriced. But I really struggle with knowing the value of social media.

Apple. Almost no-one cares about a better laptop. They're struggling to add much to a phone. VR headset was a disaster. Watches are done. P/E of 42? Get real. There's no growth story here and cheapo £200 Moto phones are very capable now. It's as boring as TVs. $140 tops.

NVDA. I don't work in AI model training, so it's impossible for me to know if there's really growth in the future, if people are going to use RISC-V based solutions, custom chips etc. It's the same problem to me of Estee Lauder. I'm a man, I don't wear makeup. How do I know if they have a better product range than Coty or L'Oreal?

Amazon. My issue with Amazon is that I am buying more and more stuff from BABA. If it's a weird thing or I can live without for a fortnight - BABA. I'm not even saying that BABA are going to wipe out Amazon, but it feels like a constraint on growth. And as for AWS and cloud, similar issues to Microsoft. $120 would be my top price.

I'd consider buying if their ttm EPS, extrapolated from 5 year avg revenue growth over the next 5 years, was a 50% discount to the 10 year Treasury yield (presently 4.631%).

           Extrapolated  Bid at 2029 9.26%  Discount to 
    Company   2029 EPS    earnings yield    12-27 close
    Apple      $10.33        $111.57         -56.35%
    NVIDIA     $22.58        $243.83          77.97%
    Microsoft  $23.48        $253.51         -41.12%
    Alphabet   $17.17        $185.38          -3.83%
    Amazon     $10.34        $111.65         -50.10%
    Meta       $45.87        $495.29         -17.42%
    Tesla      $13.24        $142.94         -66.89%
    Broadcom   $10.93        $117.98         -51.20%
    TSMC       $14.65        $158.23         -21.53%

Personally, I regard all as overvalued, as they're hitting constraints in their production or markets that aren't reflected in past revenue growth. But some like Tesla are more overvalued, and others like NVIDIA may be only slightly overvalued.

Google and Nvidia 

About Nvidia, if you look at their business you will realize they are atleast 10 years ahead of competition. Not so much for the hardware side, more so on software side which people often overlook. What we are seeing right now with AI is BREAKTHROUGH tech. It's similar to when first Iphone was released (actually much more impactful than that if you think about it) 

Current gen LLMs are going to only get better with time, maybe not at the same staggering pace we saw in past couple of years but will continue to get better with more companies funding it's research and adaption (also national governments). Personally,  I use ChatGPT more often than google search now, it's only when ChatGPT fails to do something do I manually use Google. It's just a small example but a significant one. Nvidia's data centre business is growing massively aswell, their new Blackwell series GPU are already fully pre-booked through end of 2025 with demand exceeding supply. I feel Nvidia is still a good buy at current levels. Nvidia is about 20% of my portfolio  which I wish to increase in event of a correction. 

About Google....they are Google.

Comment by youknowitistrue at 2024-12-30 02:19:33+00:00:
From the perspective of a value investor, AMZN, I would not buy at any price. This stock is on a 30 year run of bending reality and at some point seems poised to crumble. They have $270 billion in plant property and equipment on the balance sheet and it keeps going up. Their capital expenditures on this are around $63 billion per year. 

Spending $270 billion on capex over the last 10 years isn’t a problem if you’re generating earnings to complement it, but they aren’t, not even on an annual basis. And they are spending an insane amount on R&D. 

For every $1 they put into capex they return 60 cents. If any other company did that they would be cratering. 

For comparison, Walmart generates about $1.05 for every $1 spend on capex and Home Depot is returning $2. 

This why I don’t care what people say, this is NOT a tech company. They are being valued like one and it’s not accurate. Sure if you pull AWS out, that would be a tech company. But Amazon itself has more plant property and equipment on its balance sheet than wal mart, target and Home Depot combined, that is fucking insane.

Stop trying to time the market. If you have a lump sum that is a different story but if your assets that you need to invest are just a fraction of what you'll earn in the next 5 years just dollar cost average and you'll be fine. Just expect huge volatility. Unless you want to understand how to Value companies in which case other than Google or maybe meta you probably wouldn't be buying any of these other companies

The fact that people are still using PE is utterly insane to me. Do people realize earnings are artificially low due to Arcane Gaap practices? A company can buy a big stupid building and capitalize it and expense it over 10 years but if a company like Google invests huge sums of money into Quantum Computing research and development they have to expense it one year. Go back and apply a capitalization structure for r d And sales and marketing And then restate earnings based on that comma You'll see the return on invested Capital actually decreases quite a bit But they're effective earnings Increases

Conclusion: Tsla is extremely overvalued, apple & Microsoft are overvalued. Google and amzn are a little overvalued. Baba is extremely undervalued. 
So sell mag7 and buy baba

Sorry, not understanding the apple section - would you prefer more such buyback or less (none)? From an investor point of view, I would think stock buybacks are good for investors because it ramps the value of existing shares, if there is no obvious avenue for traditional growth.

Pretty decent response, I really do agree with respect to apple. They have to buy back shares since so many retail investors just look at EPS growth. If people looked at their top line they would see they are declining company. They are better off paying a dividend at these prices. Honestly comma I would love them to issue huge amounts of stock Just to open up A venture fund And public equities portfolio Higher some professional money managers And invest that money because I can assure you in the long term Selling stock at those prices And reinvesting those assets into other equities is much more profitable in the long term than buying back Apple shares

Didn’t Apple announce the buyback around may when prices were around 160 to 170…. PE was closer to 30 or lower… other side it was probably a sale from BRK to Apple… I think value was created for shareholders… they don’t pay a high free cash flow payout ratio… and over ten years it’s been going from like 25% to 15% and reducing outstanding shares by 35%… I think Apple is moving along fine… I won’t add at this time but I won’t sell either… also I turn off drip atm… but over wise I am leaving it in Apple… I agree with the other assessment Google is fair… I won’t touch tsla… Amazon is fair… I think the other companies I would add little bits at a time… I don’t see a discount for any of them at the moment… so I would build a bigger size in Microsoft and Google and Amazon… in that order

Comment by StandardAd239 at 2025-01-02 01:32:20+00:00:
Depreciation is to match revenues to expenses. That big stupid building is a part of your operations and expensing it in one period doesn't capture the true net income (or loss) of each year you're in that building. You wouldn't expense a 5-year lease term in year 1. 

Additionally, depending on the R&D they're performing, they may be able to capitalize some of those costs. However, expensing R&D in most cases makes sense otherwise a company can start justifying any expense as R&D.

Buybacks destroy value if they’re done at overvalued prices. They reduce cash on the balance sheet.

Apple should be paying dividends and reducing buybacks to 0 at current prices.
----------------------------------------
Comment by analbuttlick at 2024-12-29 17:56:19+00:00:
I usually agree when growth stagnates, buybacks can be good to prop up EPS. But with their current valuation spending that money on other avenues would make more sense to me, seeing as they can’t reduce outstanding shares by more than 3% spending fking 100B
----------------------------------------
Comment by worlds_okayest_skier at 2024-12-29 17:58:08+00:00:
I think increasing the dividend would be better than buying shares at a 40PE for a no growth company.
----------------------------------------
Comment by analbuttlick at 2024-12-29 17:47:41+00:00:
$100B for a 3% increase in EPS? That sounds like really bad value to me. But maybe i’m in the minority. I’d rather they spend money on growth, acquisitions, r&d. Because they haven’t grown for 3 years now. 

I understand the aggressive buyback at 15 and 20 PE, where they can reduce share count by 5 - 10% with a lot less money during one calendar year. But buying back at 40PE, and literally spending all of their operating income on 3% share reduction? Yeah i think its a really bad allocation of money

Only reason is I looked at Google first a decade ago, and have some spreadsheets that use PE to make simple valuation estimates.

I looked at Microsoft for the first time later, and ended up using FCF for valuation estimates. 

Just have stuck with these since - no reason besides I don’t wanna redo spreadsheets/historic stuff.

Sidenote: don’t forget SBC, PE and FCF are significantly impacted by it - screeners aren’t accurate.

Comment by Teembeau at 2024-12-29 21:23:42+00:00:
What I'd like to know is how much growth is because of new business demands and how much is cloud migration.

Cloud migration is when a business shifts its data and processing from servers that they manage (what are known as on-premise) to cloud. Like I was involved in an organisation that had all its customers and warranty information going back years.

So, let's say there was $0 of billing on Azure, and we shift everything over a couple of months. Now, billing is going to shoot up to $300/month. But that's everything to now, 10 years of data. That's like 200,000 customers with something like 500,000 product warranties. What's it going to look like in a year? Well, we're going to add something like 1 year of data, which is not going to be the storage for another 200,000 customers, but more like 20,000 customers.

See, I'm very sceptical that the ongoing demand for computing growth is as much as 30% per year, in general. Your bank, an ecommerce company you use, a warranty company is not doing 30% more transactions, warranties etc every year. Not on average. They might add some extra processes that require more compute demand, but even that doesn't do it. Which leads me to conclude that this 30% growth is a lot about taking on the on-premise business. Which is a one-off, a special level of growth and once most companies have migrated, growth will be a lot smaller.

I'll also mention growing competition in this field. There are some "moats" around some aspects of AWS, Azure, but there's also a lot of things that are not moats. Just wanting some web servers hosted is a very generic thing and not that hard to move. Maybe Alibaba Cloud or the one that Lidl runs in Europe are cheaper.

It’s not how they treat shareholders, it’s how poorly they’re utilizing their cash. There’s a lot of ways money can be spent more efficiently than buying shares back when you’re at a P/E of 40. At that price dividends would be a better use of capital.

Interesting, I find Alphabet way harder to value considering I have no idea what LLMs willdo to search. The question you have to ask yourself is if you consider tesla a car or technology company and value accordingly.

Nvidia is bringing a revolution in the world of computing... Already before the year 2000 Nvidia's GPUs were performing calculation for which super computers would have taken a week. Letting the trading hype aside.,nvidia creates value, immense value. I remember a quote from Jensen (CEO): "The world of computing is a rocket ship moving at the speed of light. Are you in?". If Coca Cola and Apple where value investments to the legendary Warren, Nvidia is not less than them and will prove it.

Tesla has a magnitude more cars on the road using FSD and if you would look at the latest videos they are really really close. The biggest difference is that Tesla does it in a way that's not only a fraction of the cost, but also scalable. If Tesla makes this happen Waymo and Baidu are gone. There is absolutely no way they could compete.

Comment by citationII at 2024-12-29 16:47:17+00:00:

You're assuming it's a zero sum game with a winner takes all approach in regards to auto.

There is no denying China will dominate EVs, alongside Tesla. Their rise will be the demise of legacy auto, who are still in first gear.

They fully admitted they were tele operated by a human at their event. Not sure on your point. Have you seen their hand dexterity? Or Optimus walking unsupervised outside, slipping down a hill and then self correcting? It's highly impressive. You also have to remember Tesla has the manufacturing capacity and knowledge too, unlike many of the competitors.

What do you think the most advanced AI is?

If you look at something like GPT3, it seems to me that if FSD will do what you seem to expect, Tesla would destroy the entire AI market. It seems like a ridiculous expectation to me.

OK, maybe I didn't express myself appropriately and clear enough. I do agree that valuing a company has nothing to do with their stock, but I wanted to say that I am not interested in a company with such a behavior of their stock (Tesla).

You are missing the point of value investing. You want to buy assets cheaper than their intrinsic value.

No value investor is buying TSLA now because the free cash flow yield is something like 0.3%. It would likely take at least a decade to get anywhere close to a 4% bond.

You have listed some good companies but what matters just as much, or even more, is the price you are paying versus the intrinsic value. 

When you look at it this way, you could have these companies on a watchlist with price targets to buy but it would not make sense to buy a basket of companies or pre determining your buys without taking the stock price and stock price evolution into consideration. Most superinvestors will buy between 0 and 3 stocks in a quarter choosing what proposes the best value at a given point in time

Invest in well-managed companies with low debt in under-appreciated, out-of-favour, beaten-down sectors. In other words, put your money into shit no one’s paying attention to now so you make it hand over fist when they eventually do.

If everything costs too much, invest in cash (short-term treasury bonds) like daddy Buffett and wait patiently in the bushes for opportunities.

"In 1929, at the height of an economic boom in America, Joseph Kennedy Sr. (father of JFK) was working as a stockbroker on Wall Street. As the story goes, Joseph was walking around when he decided to sit down for a shoeshine. While polishing his shoes, the young worker gave Joseph some of his favorite stock picks. When Joseph heard the shoeshine boy giving out stock tips, he figured the party was about to end, and it was time to get out of the market. Joseph proceeded to exit his positions in the market and bought short positions that bet on the market going down.

Shortly after that, the stock market entered a free fall. On Monday, October 28, 1929, the market dropped about 13%. The next day it fell another 12%. These became better known as Black Monday and Black Tuesday, and ushered the United States into The Great Depression.

 It's estimated that he made somewhere north of $150 million during that period, which equates to roughly $3.5 billion in today’s dollars."

Yeah it is okay. 

My comments:

- don’t buy all at once. Consider to buy in 1/3s. 

- **some** of your stocks are very popular (and hence, can be considered as **momentum stocks**, consider getting a couple of value stocks as well ( this is r/ valueinvesting after all). Momentum stock does well when the market is going up. 

For example, look at last Friday, many (not all) of  the value stocks went up or fell less than the index, these would include food stocks (Hershey , nestle, Modelez, Pepsi, Diageo), defensive stocks like Unilever, P&G. For stocks previously beaten down, like Starbucks.

My core portfolio is still US tech - amzn, msft, Goog as i think they can continue to compound earnings and can still cut costs further. Their cost bases are super bloated and super inefficient. I know highly oaid people there who maybe do 10 hours of work a week

also own UBS, JPM, Rheinmetall, ASML/ASMI

Think Ryanair is a great value here still. Same with TUI ag on travel recovery and deleveraging

on small cap side i think ITM power and Filtronic in the UK and higher risk but high reward. Match group i own as a takeover target. Same with Senior plc in the UK $SNR

I also own DKNG and Flutter in OSB

in the US small cap like Amex GBT $GBTG - 4bn mkt cap

cheap once you assume all the CWT acquisition synergies which closes in 2025 and is not in sellside numbers

market worried about AI while in reality its an opp for them to take cost out. takeover target for SAP or Uber

Tejon ranch $TRC is also highly speculative but interesting from land bank point of view

Not sure that is the right way to go about it. The upside in the large cap stocks is not that big. if you have time to do the research maybe focus on small and medium caps with strong fundamentals and future market trends backing it to select your stocks. Personally I do my own research (videos, articles, news, consumer/society trends) and use the below stocks rating platform to know more about entry, exit and fundamentals.

You might want to consider diversification.  All of these stocks, except Costco, are essentially in the tech sector.  They may continue to outperform but if there is a tech bubble as some people propose they will all crash hard together.  

To reduce this risk you add stocks from other sectors or buy a broad market ETF like VOO or VTI.

Right now, especially about a month ago, everyone was high on Google for the tech sector.  

Some other large cap US companies from other sectors I’m considering adding to are VZ and PEP but admittedly I’m an amateur myself.  You can read other posts on here about how to value a company since some of your picks are generally considered overvalued (TSLA, PLTR).

Comment by RationalExuberance7 at 2024-12-29 10:27:10+00:00:
I hate to say it, but I’m going to go with the obvious for 2025.

I’m going to choose 3 big tech companies that are developing advanced AI and cloud, are at or near a 10 year low, and trading at a PE of 11, have very high moats - much more than Amazon, have huge potential to grow 10x over a few years, have up to 30% of their market values in pure cash, are buying back 10% a year, some of these trading near or below their IPO 10-15 years ago while their revenues have grown 10x to 15x.

Don’t make me say the names, you know who I’m talking about. It’s always the obvious companies that are extremely cheap that people avoid.

The only reason to choose Tesla is the assumption that the cult will increase even further and Elmo will level up his shadiness now that he directly influences the government

Ah yes. What a bad deal to buy META covered by 20 analysts at $90 in 2022 in our hyper efficient market. It sure has underperformed QQQ since /s

I always wonder if in the late '90s everyone was talking about General Electric, Pfizer, Intel, IBM, Coca-Cola, Exxon, Disney etc the same way as they talk about the mag7 right now. Somehow almost every top S&P500 company back then underperformed the index the next 20-25 years.
----------------------------------------
Comment by blackicebaby at 2024-12-29 23:16:45+00:00:
no, just buy SPY or VOO. megacap make up almost 40% of the index. much better vs QQQ, risk wise.

4% high yield savings acc no minimum amount if I remember correctly. Very easy to use. And they have a thing where u get $75 if someone uses your link and they get $25.

No. Those are not value stocks. Pure growth and momentum stocks. I own both, but those stocks are NOT longterm investments at current levels. The whole sector is in infancy.

They will get obliterated in a market correction. 

Same goes for RKLB, any quantum stocks and AI stocks besides mag7 since they have other revenue streams. And to a certain degree SOFI.

In comparison to JOBY and ACHR are SOFI and RKLB more mature companies (transforming revenue into earnings; products in the market, more mature market) but still huge gambles.

I couldn’t recommend COST as a buy with a P/E near 60 and a 400 billion dollar market cap.  It’s going to take an insane amount of growth over the next decade to justify its current share price.

I feel like buying one share everytime I go to COSTCO and see that crowd. Sadly the price is too high, they need to split the stock already. I am doing fractional shares for now. :)

Oil stocks are dumpster fire, OXY and Halliburton could be good picks. 

Weed stocks get shat on hard (most of them justifiably), but not all are terrible. High Tide and Green Thumb could be good picks going forward. Multiples on them are screaming value to me. 

Car manufacturers are also struggling - Ford, VW…

I bought META at $90 lmao. Who you talking to?

In fact, half of these may not be that bad. I own several from some time ago. But the market is objectively more efficient for these Megacaps than it is for small caps. Seeing GOOGL and AMZN for the 10000th time on this isn't any different from the 9999th. Except this post isn't even pick Google and Amazon. It's literally "buy mag 7". Wow, I wonder how funds with their billions of dollars and liquidity being the only limiting factor haven't thought of just investing into them???

Thanks although I think you have taken my comment about ‘great value’ out of context. Understandably perhaps in a ‘ValueInvesting‘ thread.

However given the OP (‘asking what stocks have bolstered your portfolio?’) I still believe in what I opined. Time will tell if I was right.

I also disagree with your statement as a fact that ‘they will get obliterated in a market correction’. Clearly nobody can know that for certain and I being more optimistic am further towards the end of the spectrum that they may not get obliterated. Especially given (but not limited to) potential support that may be forthcoming from the incoming White House administration;

‘Just as the United States led the automotive revolution in the last century, I want to ensure that America – not China – leads this revolution in air mobility,‘ Trump said in the video, which he posted on his social media platform Truth Social. ‘These breakthroughs can transform commerce, bring a giant infusion of wealth into rural America, and connect families and our country in new ways.’\*

I agree that they should announce a split already. The price is high, but I have a strong conviction in the company and its potential for future expansion into rural and international markets. Every time a new store is opened it becomes an instant hit. Well managed company, high employee morale, loyal consumer base, and unbeatable pricing & membership model make it an obvious buy regardless of what the P/E experts say. I’ll continue to invest in what I see is clearly working, and so far it’s proven to be a lucrative strategy. People have been saying it’s been priced too high seemingly forever and it continues to go up regardless.

By that logic all investing is gambling which in fairness is sort of true. Ever notice the same China discount isnt accounted for in names like sbux and aapl despite a large chunk of revenue and growth coming from there? Point being the market is not particularly efficient. No one knows the future but buying companies at those kind of valuations will more likely than not lead to better long term returns than the growth and momentum plays Reddit loves.

only one overpriced is TSLA and you can't disagree on this because you can't deny that almost +90% gain in recent 2 months was a Trump trade. TSLA has a fair value under a C-note.

Revenue and earnings are expected to grow double digits over the next several years and it has a buyback equal to 10% of the market cap. And of course the balance sheet is perfect.

Being its DOD, it’ll be recession proof. 50% profit margins expected next year with at least 10% added for AI software. Guiding revenue of 80-120M for next year, when it’s all said and done 250-300M wouldn’t even surprise me. Buying below $12 is a steal. Under $15 is a good sale.

I have few for you. See below the analysis we run on them using their latest 10Q and market data.

Fabrinet 

Fabrinet presents a compelling investment opportunity based on its strong financial performance and  positioning. The company has demonstrated significant revenue growth, particularly in the Datacom and automotive sectors, and maintains a robust cash position with no debt, which provides financial flexibility. Despite some concerns over stock-based compensation and capital expenditures, these are outweighed by the company's effective cost management, stable gross margins, and strategic investments in expanding manufacturing capacity. The short-term HOLD recommendation is primarily due to market volatility and competitive pressures, but the long-term BUY recommendation is supported by Fabrinet's strong fundamentals and growth prospects in key markets. The financial statement analysis further reinforces the BUY recommendation, highlighting the company's financial health and potential for sustained growth.

  
F5 Inc

F5, Inc. presents a compelling investment opportunity based on its strong financial performance, strategic focus on AI and cloud services, and effective cost management. The company's recent record revenue and growth in its software segment, along with strategic initiatives like the AI Gateway, position it well for future growth. Despite a slight decline in product revenues, the shift towards subscription-based models and increased service revenues indicate a positive long-term trajectory. The technical analysis shows a bullish trend, although the stock is currently overbought, suggesting potential short-term volatility. However, the company's strong balance sheet, with more cash than debt, and the absence of goodwill impairments, further support its financial stability. The financial statement analysis highlights effective cost management, strong cash flow generation, and a strategic share repurchase program, all of which reinforce confidence in F5's future prospects. Given these factors, a BUY recommendation is justified for both short-term and long-term investment horizons.

  
Fortinet

Fortinet, Inc. demonstrates strong financial health and growth potential, as evidenced by its impressive revenue and profitability increases, strategic acquisitions, and robust balance sheet. The company's strategic positioning in the growing cybersecurity market, coupled with its competitive advantages such as proprietary technology and strategic acquisitions, further bolster its growth prospects. Despite some risks, such as competition and reliance on stock-based compensation, the overall financial and market indicators are positive. The technical analysis supports a strong upward trend, and both short-term and long-term outlooks are favorable. The financial statement analysis confirms strong operational performance and financial stability, with positive revenue growth, improved margins, and effective cost management. Therefore, a BUY recommendation is justified, as the positive factors significantly outweigh the negatives, indicating potential for continued growth and profitability.

Please expand on your hypothesis. 

I see them being cheap, but I also see rapidly declining revenue and margins with a side of 100 billion investment in the last 3 years with no real way of knowing if the foundry business will ever take off. 

And the guy that came up with the plan was fired.

They also look cheap when compared to their book value, but a lot of the assets are Goodwill, and debt has piled up with all that Capex and R&D spending (20 billion per year for 3 years and nothing to show for it yet).

Thought they would've had a replacement for Pat by now, and that only makes me more skeptical: is it because it's all a dumpster fire and no one wants to partake in it?

What am I not seeing?

Comment by youknowitistrue at 2024-12-19 22:33:05+00:00:
Can’t answer for OP, but if you want to see what I think a lot of people see, look at the last 10 years for google and look at their revenue and earnings growth. 10 years ago it did $66 billion in sales. Now it’s doing $339 billion in sales TTM. And over that time it’s grown after tax earnings from $13 billion to $94 billion TTM. 

If you look at that growth over that time, and then consider the current price, I think that’s where people consider it “undervalued”. Basically, if you anticipate it will continue kicking ass like this, $188 per share is nothing. Because at this rate it will have about $987 share price in 10 years at its current P:E of 25. 

It hinges on whether you think it will continue to kick ass. If you don’t believe in that, then it wouldn’t be undervalued.

They’re absolutely competitors. Netflix is their competitor too. Minecraft is their competitor, etc. 

There’s no doubt that Instagram reels and YouTube shorts would be the biggest beneficiaries of a TikTok ban. But there’s also no doubt that TikTok in the us disappearing would  cause an increased in engagement and therefore ad dollars on Pinterest. But just to be clear, possible TikTok ban would just be a cherry on top. Pinterest is a great investment on valuation, growth, & business model alone. It’s a calming, peaceful, creative social media platform, unlike the political battlefields of Facebook, twitter, etc.

Are you not concerned about the Stock based compensation eating up over 77% of the free cash flow? Not to mention the SBC growing at almost the exact same rate at the FCF. Both these factors leave almost nothing for shareholders. Pinterest also has an extensive history of diluting shareholders (averaging at 18.56% percent over the past decade).
----------------------------------------
Comment by TheDonFulio at 2024-12-19 01:27:53+00:00:
Yeah, you’re mistaken if you think people are going from Tik Tok to Pinterest. Maybe a small few percent, but 95% would be going to other places that host short form videos.

as a business I would never invest with them. They have no moat, nothing makes them more interesting than their competitors, they are a commodity stock.

NVIDIA was smart about their API and custom functions.

So... to paraphrase Buffet, you are buying a company, not a stock price and in that sense, AMD is a turd.

EDIT: I also don't buy NVIDIA BTW, for different reasons

Comment by youknowitistrue at 2024-12-19 22:42:23+00:00:
I think what you missed is up to you, as I said. If DCF at 15% for 20-30 years is the only way you value stocks, then yeah, it’s overvalued. 

You have to look at valuation differently to see google as undervalued. Which, make no mistake about it, GOOGL has kicked ass over the last 10 years. If you had put $100k into it in 2014, you’d have $590K today. 

So like I said, it’s up to what you believe about the stock and how you invest, I can’t answer that for you. 

For me, a long term holder, I like it at $188.

Comment by TheDonFulio at 2024-12-20 16:03:01+00:00:

Because I’ve done my research. They spent 5 years trying to win this government contract, beating out the Incumbent Skydio, specifically creating a drone to the Army’s parameters. It’s worth some 220M over 5 years (likely going to be much larger as this “order” was made pre Ukraine war) and they are guiding for 50% profit margins on 6+ years of follow-up orders. Add Palantir’s software for probably 10-20% with a 90% profit margin and last quarters unprofitability doesn’t matter. Market is forward looking.

Normally if done in great enough amounts,it would, but what I’m seeing with Pinterest is zero indication they have any interest in returning the $2.44 billion of cash they have on hand to shareholders through either buy backs or dividends. Pinterest has never done a dividend and has never done a consistent buyback program. My guess is Pinterest is saving all this cash for any acquisition opportunity in the future, which more often then not are a killer to shareholders value.

Motley fools had PINS  listed as a buy last month I think. I’m a long time user of Pinterest. 

Lately many (especially home decorating) stuff has been bad AI versions. Also ads lately have been out of control. If you think it’s a cool thing to pin to your page often it’s a disguised ad and sends you to Temu, Wayfair or Amazon… TOTALLY annoying interface the way it’s done. Especially getting stuck in Temu’s spin to win cycle. Ugh.

I’m hearing grumbling about those issues on several artist chat groups I’m in.  So because of the AI and my annoyance factor I’m using it less and less and decided not to invest in it.

According to seeking alpha there TTM SBC adjusted FCF is 200 million. Where the hell did you get you 2 billion? I think you were looking at cash on hand.

Edit: after adjusting for SBC the FCF yield is a whopping 0.01%. Guessing that’s why it’s languished. Terrible valuation and profitability.

You’re right, the quick ai search I did was likely giving me operating cash flow. also it’s not 0.01%, it’s 1%, which is almost identical to meta. 

But again, the dilution that happens because of sbc is offset by the $2 billion stock buyback. So your fcf yield also needs to adjust for buyback, not just sbc. So you could say the buyback isn’t as lucrative for that reason for sure, but you can’t say management is taking all of the free cash flow because going forward that’s not the case.

Title: Stocks to buy for the long term
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1hv8z5k/stocks_to_buy_for_the_long_term/
Comment by pbemea at 2025-01-06 20:57:36+00:00:
The baseline activity for new investors is probably to buy a low cost S&P index fund like SPY, VOO, or FXAIX.

tl;dr follows...

The next step is to read. "Psychology of Money" by Housel is a great book. It's less about stock picking and more about being human and dealing with fear and greed. It's very accessible to the lay investor.

That said, your investing super-power right now is time. You have lots of it. It's OK to make mistakes as a young person. Just don't blow the rent money. Having your first $1,000 invested get cut in half is a lesson like no other. At least for me. I know how to read. Pain teaches me soooo much better.

Don't pay fees. Your homework is to identify the net expense ratio of the SPY. It's a simple question, but doing it yourself is how you get started in being a thoughtful investor. You have to read the prospectus. Always identify the fees. Fees are deadly.

Nobody knows when there will be a dip. It's called timing the market. Professionals can't time the market. Nobody can time the market. Don't even try. Put your excess funds to work in the market as soon as you acquire them.

The best question you asked is "What price?" That is the bread and butter of this sub. I'll get you started. The historical price to earning ratio (PE) of the S&P500 is about 15.

More homework for you. Identify the PE multiples of the stocks you listed. Then think about whether or not the prices you will pay for the stocks listed is cheap or expensive.

Please note: this homework assignment is the very beginning of a journey. I'm just getting you started.

I'm sure someone will come in a discuss all manner of terrifying pricing models. Ignore them for now.

Looking up the PE is easy. Determining if a price is cheap or expensive is wickedly hard. That's what this subreddit is all about.

A couple of things

1. Typically as a new investor you should start with index funds like the S&P 500. So I would buy the S&P 500.

2. Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. Those 4 companies alone already make up close to 20% of the total value of the S&P 500. My advice I would just buy the S&P 500. 

3. I would buy the S&P 500.

Very tech heavy. Tech is priced to the moon right now.

As a girl in her twenties, you might actually have more insight than you think on the future.

Places you shop , things you and your friends buy. Do you travel and how do you purchase it? There could be opportunities you're overlooking that are right under your nose. What's on your credit card bill? What credit card do you use? Do you shop at Amazon and Walmart?

That doesn't mean everywhere you spend money is a good company , but it's a good place to start and will get you thinking, and then you can try to find value from there.

With all that said, your best bet probably is to just make a habit to add an equal amount of money to a s&p 500 ETF a couple times a month for years and years.

You'll have to define what you think "long term" means but if you're talking 10+ years, I don't think you can think of any stock in those terms.

There are retailers that failed to grasp the internet in the 1990s. HP was atrociously managed and instead of being the leaders in handheld computing, Apple beat them. 2006, if you'd say "maybe Apple will come along with a new phone and annihilate Nokia over a decade people would have laughed at you. Nokia were this unassailable giant.

Right now I don't like Apple because smartphones, laptops, watches are all about as dull as microwave ovens. I'm not using a £200 droid because I can't afford an £800 iPhone 16. It's because I think there's about £30 of extra benefits from spending £600 more, and so I'd rather upgrade the quality of my Pinot Noir or coffee. P/E of 40 for a company that's as dull as Dell (22 P/E) makes no sense as an investment.

If you're not going to take an interest in a company on quite a regular basis, figuring out when it's cheap or expensive, what some new service is likely to mean, what a management change means, you should probably just put money into an S&P ETF or buy a load of Berkshire Hathaway.

Obligatory [Peter Lynch 1997 speech](https://youtu.be/myu4Nv0pt0U?si=_tMiBw1t4ZxK7OgI) plug. I strongly advice you learn from it before proceeding. Tells you the basic essentials.

My personal take: You should not invest in stocks if you have to consult reddit (or really anyone who isn't your educated self) about what to buy and at what price. You can look externally for ideas and information, that's what this sub is for, but you need to be able to evaluate it on your own before you invest.

Some or most of the stocks you list are quite overvalued - the fact that you're long term doesn't change that they're a bad idea to own, imo. 

Oh and take everything you read on here and anywhere about investing with a grain of salt. Including this.

I can only let you know what looks good to me. We are in a generally inflated and speculative market. IMHO it's important to keep each individual equity as a very small percentage of net worth. I won't mention my biggest holding since it's very volatile and in large part an arb. 

From biggest position to smallest, roughly: PEP, NSRGY, KFT, LYB, DOW, SLB, CAG, SJM, UPS, CHTR. With less of a growth profile (but I have more HSY than everything in the preceding list except KFT while the rest are about the same as the tail end of that list) also in descending order HSY, GIS, OXY, XOM. 

I don't recommend these stocks. They're dogs that are underperforming the S&P 500. That's why they are relatively cheap. It's hard psychologically to own stocks without just giving in to crowd sentiment. Yet that road leads to tulip mania - which is only fun while it lasts. Indexing is a great alternative except the indexes are finding ways to tulip too.

If you must buy stocks, buy a stock like it's a house. Move in and expect to stay there for many years. But keep a wary eye on it for cracks in the foundation and termites. Sell it if there's a problem. I realized decades ago that cash is the other short play, and it can pay.

I have kids and know this post is boring. Value investing is boring. I am boring. Time for my nap.

I’ve seen some other say it as well but the best course of action to is aim for simply easily achievable capital gains. Picking individual stocks is a daunting task and carries significant risk, especially at current market levels. I’d recommend buying low-cost ETF’s such as ITOT, SPSM, VT etc etc. reinvest those dividends and even Dollar-cost average and you’ll be happy years from now

I'd recommend setting up an auto invest in an index fund with part of your investment budget first. Index fund investing on auto pilot will grow over time and dollar cost avg the highs and lows. Then use some of remaining budget to look at individual stocks.

You’re off to an amazing start with NVDA, WM, and OWL: great choices for a strong long-term foundation! The stocks you’re considering (AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, ASML, MSFT) are all industry leaders with incredible growth potential. Instead of waiting for a dip, consider dollar-cost averaging to smooth out market fluctuations over time. You’re clearly doing your research, and with your focus on strong companies, you’re setting yourself up for long-term success. Keep it up,you’re doing great!

Whatever you end up buying do your best not to check the prices daily. If you’re holding for a long term investment there is no need. 
That and if (fingers crossed not anytime soon) we hit a nasty recession keep investing. Don’t stop because your portfolio’s halved. Just keep investing.

A good rule is looking for the first stocks that lead following a correction or who began to run before the correction completed. Those to me are AVGO, VRT, LB, GEV. The dip in December provided a beautiful buying opportunity. Semis corrected, energy just lagging for the longest time but bullish with new president. Biotech has been slumping forever- that would be a sector to keep an eye on as well as healthcare.

You’ve picked strong, reliable companies for long-term growth, and dollar-cost averaging is a great way to avoid stressing over market timing. Focus on consistent investments, and over time, you’ll build a solid portfolio.

Comment by jacobzacr at 2025-01-07 15:22:03+00:00:
Here's how I do it !! 

1. I spend my time and energy in researching individual stocks because i'd like to buy potential multibaggers. I don't buy the index because I am looking for returns greater than what the broader market provides.
2. I spend at least 3-4 hours a week researching stock ideas but I TRANSACT IN THE MARKET ONLY 3 OR 4 TIMES IN A YEAR. Meaning I buy only when I believe the opportunity is absolutely absolutely right. 
3. Research the heck out of the company and it's business. Do not worry too much about the broader direction of market ( bull or bear). Remember that you'd still be in Red, had you bought Intel or Biogen during COVID crash times. So in the long term it's the quality of the business and not the direction of the broader market which matters.
4. Always remember that STOCK PRICES FOLLOW EARNINGS IN THE LONG TERM. Focus is on the word 'Long Term'. So avoid knee jerk reactions and respond to news using a rational head.
5. When you are buying individual stock, PRICE OF ENTRY IS VERY VERY CRUCIAL. Always have margin of safety. Even if the business is amazing and it ticks all boxes, buy the stock only with a margin of safety. This is the reason why I transact only 3 or 4 times in a year eventhough I spend a lot of time researching stocks. ( This doesn't apply if you are using other strategies like DCAing the Index. But when you buy the index, you will get only market returns - you will not land a career defining multi bagger ).
6. NEVER PLAY WITH FUTURES / OPTIONS / DERIVATIVES. There's a reason why Peter Lynch and Warren Buffet thought these instruments of financial suicide should be made illegal.

Don't buy individual companies at your stage. Just dollar cost average into indexes. It won't be as fun or exciting, but you will do a hell of a lot better than investing into these names you mentioned which are arguably at the upper ends of their valuations.

Comment by Ambitious-Fix-6406 at 2025-01-06 21:58:41+00:00:
If you're investing in the long term, do what Warrenn Buffett would tell you: get a cheap accumulating ETF on the SP500 (a global one is also fine) and don't think about it at all.

In fact, it's very likely that with your strategy, in the long term you will severely underperform. Actually considering the current ballooning valuations you should expect the returns for these companies to be lower in the future, not better than the market unless their earnings skyrocket (and some of the companies you've bought like Apple have flat growth since years).

You're very unlikely to beat the markets long term by stock picking. People here will recommend you various stuff that it may or may not makes sense, but why bother taking a chance? Only few retail investors outperform the benchmark over 10 years, virtually nobody does for 20. Why would you think you or users here would be different?

\> I recently bought NVDA, WM, OWL. I’m considering AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, ASML, MSFT. 

That's like buying IBM and Intel 30 years ago when they were the largest companies in the planet. Nonsense. Why would you assume that today's winner will be forever winners? You're applying a misjudgement common to investors called "recency bias".

It's just non sense, get an accumulating ETF on the SP500 like VOO or whatever is the equivalent tracking the FTSE All World Index (so you don't even need to care if some emerging market or China or whatever or US performs better, you just own the global economy and don't care).

I recommend you watching this Ben Felix video "Who should NOT invest in total market index funds":

buying single stocks have more risk associated than just investing in an index etf (diversification) but if you go the single stock route all the ones you listed are pretty good!! 

i’m the same as you and i’ve invested heavily in NVDA and RKLB (def do research on rklb before you invest but it’s a solid company that could potentially see a lot of growth) and then I have positions in GOOG, AMZN, MSFT and AAPL. you can never really go wrong with mag7 stocks fr fr, but you can also never go wrong with just investing in VOO (s&p etf)!! 

If you’re like me and don’t have a ton of capital to invest, like others you see on here, don’t try and open a bunch of positions in different stocks but find a the few solid companies you can see steadily growing and invest in those!! NVDA has a lot of hype around it (rightfully so) and it’s my biggest position rn and behind that is rklb:) in the future i plan on trimming those when i see good gains and funneling it into VOO. also open a roth ira and try to max it out!! tax free gains!!

How about learning to use a stock screener? Not trying to be a dick but it would behoove you to learn about earnings, P/E, Forward PE, debt to net, etc, etc. 
I gotta ask, did you read a single prospectus for what you bought? Caveat Empor. 
If you are just swinging a bat in the China shop at what anyone posts look at Oracle, Adobe, Micron. The RSI and P/E are good and they are substantially.discounted off the 52 week highs. 
Read the prospectus. Please. Investopedia is Free, stay off the spam and pay sites. For now.

Hopefully the OP has a 401k or other pre-tax vehicle for retirement savings.  Often those are limited in fund choices anyway.  And there I agree at age 20 just max out contributions into it, and put most or all into an index fund.

But if it is a post-tax brokerage account, that lets you invest in anything, then I would suggest splitting 40/40/20 whatever is put into it:  40% into an S&P index fund like SPY, 40% into something stable (SGOV or CDs or even just a money market), and 20% into individual stock picks as you desire.

The first 40% is your actual investment.  Don't touch it, let it grow, and keep putting 40% of your funding into that.

The second 40% is your emergency fund.  If you lose a job, need to buy a car, or have unexpected expenses, draw from this.

The last 20% is educational.  Pick individual stocks, sector funds, day trade, or whatever you wish to do to learn about stock investment.  Expect to lose most or all of this 20%, and be pleased if you get lucky and end up with more than you put in.  Just be careful at the end of the year to balance any capital gains from selling at a profit with equal losses from selling down losers, otherwise you'll owe tax on whatever you earned.

Don't get me wrong, I think it's a good company. I'm just not sure whether it's a good buy at the current price. But I see a lot of people recommending reddit, I'm just trying to understand why.

Congratulations are in order then. Most people don't and wonder what went wrong not reading the warning label. You'll be fine. Christine Benz wrote a series of articles on a modified bucket approach on Morningstar. It's a good methodology and can be applied to your stock portfolio also.

Ultimately, you're likely right which is why I suggested a small (read: speculative) position. I look at it as a fantastic tool for AI, it's a site I use every day and many others do too so I think they'll find a way to have semi-non shit ads like Instagram and other monetizing opportunities which may end up pissing me off as a long-time user. I also find myself having to add 'reddit' to anything I wanna look up on google and again, I don't think I'm the only one.

I've seen people on here compare market caps with Meta, which is absurd. A better comparison to me is Snap or Pinterest, I bought my position at roughly those 2's market cap. I think it's one of those things that a good exec team can really let rip, revenue wise. There's also the meme element, but I could see it reaching a very high (and likely not fundamentally supported) valuation, so long as they continue to make profit.

AAPL, AMZN, NVDA has growth potential in retrospect. Only few could have guessed the growth potential of NVDA 5 years ago; and no one could have guessed the Market Cap today, not even the CEO.

What you need to do is to study a market deeply. Only people who understand the chip market well could say NVDA would outperform AMD and INTL. you need an edge to detect these companies. 

That lead may be available on Reddit or social media. But It is hard to say with such noise

PFIZERs guidance for 2025  looks super solid

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-signals-growth-fy-2025-140824574.html

Nice! I just went through the summary of the call, expected EPS next year is @ $3

And revenue @ 64 bill

Potentially, I know, but That is great news !

Hope the market wakes up to this and also hoping that some of speculative billions all over the market finds its way into gold standard safe havens like PFE ( pays. A great divy too!)

News out now that RFK and trump  were wined and dined by Pfizer executives - codetalk for greasing the wheels

Market seems to have responded positively to that and the guidance revision….

Never try to find the next this or that. You will only blow yourself up. Research stocks and see what you find. If you find something that can truly become a mega cap - amazing. But it's more likely you will find more ordinary stocks and still make great returns if you're diligent. Underappreciated compounder here, cyclical turnaround there, or any kind of good old market mispricing - value.

RCI. One of the big 3 Canadian telecoms and have been on a down trend for the past 2-3 years after the spike in 2020-2022 due to high levels of immigration into Canada which in turn led to overbought/high stock prices. One of the main reason of the downtrend aka correction was because of the big investments into the 5g infrastructure at banks borrowing costs. With the debt and inflation, that led to higher debts which caused the stock to plummet down 30%ish in the 2-3 year span. With Canada cutting interest rates, this stock should rebound up with potential growth and sizeable returns in the future. Dividends, revenues and profits are stable so I believe this is a good long term stock at a bargain price, especially after today which looks like the bottom and oversold on the daily & weekly RSI scale. 

Also looking for another pull back on BA to add some additional positions.

Possibly Verde Agritech. It'd be nice if they become even better than Nutrien. 

There are several different write ups on the company which can be read. 

Current macro economics are interesting. Brazilian Real is tanking which is going to make imports painful, which is the majority of fertilizers coming into the company. 

The low Real is going to make agricultural exports easier, which will likely compound with the tariff wars the US is going to start. Going to be some export vacuums to fill as the US exports less. 

We'll see if this bolsters Verdes sales. It'll also be nice if their carbon credits are validated and their rare earth company is spun off.

Fairfax Financial fits the criteria. Earnings estimates are too low. The stock trades at 7-9x and is growing 15-20%/yr. The multiple will expand so the returns could be exceptional. Starting to see that in the past 4 years and more to come.

There's plenty of undervalued stocks right now. There's plenty of high growth stocks right now.

Are you looking for a giant on its knees or for the next 100x? Cause it's very much different.

Intel is likely a value stock right now. They might go under completely and you might lose the whole money, but they are severely undervalued. Are they going to do 100x or even 10x in 5-10 years? Not a chance.

Other than that, there's some quantum computing stocks everyone is talking about these days. I'm guessing they are either going to fail miserably, or to do your 10, 100x, eventually.

Meanwhile, you occasionally have stocks that do 10x in a day. I don't recommend those, but if you sort NYSE for "top performers of the day" you'll occasionally find those.

I’m a holder in Red cat. My advice is join the subreddit. Backlog as far as you have time to read, and start to build a basis of knowledge around the ceo and the company itself. Then read daily discussions from the last month, and then eventually take your shot. Today there was a dip that was a potential fire sale for people who have been buying in above 9s. Soon this stocks bottom floor will be 9 and it won’t go back imho.

Comment by Savings-Alarm-9297 at 2024-12-19 22:02:10+00:00:
If you guys want to actually identify an undervalued stock, you need to determine two things:

1. The growth rate priced into the stock today. 
2. The growth rate you think is correct. 


If 1 > 2, the stock is overvalued based on your estimated growth rate. If 1 < 2, the stock is undervalued. 

The term “Growth Rate” typically refers to long-term (5+ year) annual revenue growth or earnings growth. 

Whatever multiple a given company trades on (revenue or earnings), that’s the reference metric for calculating Growth Rate.

Congratulations you are now a hedge fund analyst.

Eh, personally I take Lynch with a grain of salt. I think he's of course said many valuable things but super important to note he held hundreds of stocks and had at one point some 300% turnover which he worked down to 100-150%. He also came up in a powerful bull market.


PEG ratio is fine if things are going up, but what happens if earnings collapse? PEG ratio doesn't help then - no margin of safety. With 2025 coming up and global tensions at a high and tariff talks that will impact AMZN.
----------------------------------------
Comment by Realistic_Record9527 at 2024-12-30 18:54:23+00:00:
Why do you complicate the formula because (P/E Ratio / PEG Ratio) =  EPS Growth rate, so Formula will be: Fair Value = EPS Growth rate x (EPS Growth rate + Devidend Yield). That makes non sense

I understand that P/E should be considered along with Growth, but P/E/G tries to factor oranges in with apples. I think the Forward P/E is more useful.

Comment by FrankBal at 2024-12-30 20:36:32+00:00:
This reminds me of grahams formula. 

Again the purpose is to determine a stock’s intrinsic value.


V = (EPS x (8.5 + 2g) x 4.4) / Y


Where:

	•	V: Intrinsic value

	•	EPS: Earnings per share (trailing 12 months)

	•	8.5: Base multiplier for no-growth companies

	•	g: Expected annual growth rate (%)

	•	4.4: Average corporate bond yield 

	•	Y: Current AAA-rated corporate bond yield (%)

PEG IMHO is one of the most important valuation metrics and should be considered alongside ttm p/e, forward p/e, price/sales, price/book, EnterpriseValue/revenue, Enterprisevalue/EBITDA, debt/equity, current ratio, credit ratings, reputable analyst evaluations. Lynch also describes the consumer advantage.

I don't think fundamental investing can be reduced to an algorithm, ultimately. Stock screeners are important too.

Peter Lynch’s formula evaluates stocks by combining P/E, growth, and dividends to identify undervalued opportunities, aiding growth-focused investors.

Comment by sicknessF at 2024-12-31 14:00:47+00:00:
while the formula is often attributed to Lynch, it would be more accurate to say that it’s an interpretation of his valuation methods, rather than a formula he specifically proposed or formally used.

Peter Lynch is better known for using the PEG Ratio (Price/Earnings to Growth) as a valuation metric

Lynch's PEG formula is useful but it's got some blind spots - like giving misleading results for cyclical companies or ones with unstable growth rates. That's why I made valu8.app flexible enough to combine it with other metrics in your weekly screens. Like you could add debt ratios or adjust the formula based on sector.

Comment by HumerousMoniker at 2024-12-30 23:41:22+00:00:
Which is where all of the formulas and calculations and metrics fall apart for me.  No one knows the future and the key determinant of ‘value’ is what the company will doing the future. I’ve started to turn it around a little ie: given this stock price, it implies that {company} is expected to increase earnings by x% for the next 10 years. Then it’s just a statement on if I believe that or not

Why? Honestly, the formula makes sense if you think about it. It’s blending valuation - P/E and PEG with growth and dividends. The idea is to balance growth potential with income and price - pretty standard for fundamental analysis.

If there is no measurable PEG ratio, that suggests the company is operating at a loss. That should tell you all you need to know. 

With all due respect, I have found Mr. Lynch to be of immense help. His books are among the best I have ever read on investing. Oh, and his record speaks for itself. His successors ran the Magellan Fund into the toilet. But Lynch generated astonishing returns for years. If you read any of his books, you would see that he was honest with his readers. When he made mistakes, he admitted them, just like two other men I venerate: Warren Buffett and Charles Munger. Their willingness to be both humble and honest speaks volumes.

Yea it never clicked for me why many people use the TTM for P/E in this formula mixed with a forward metric for growth rate. 

I use the current year estimate for P/E and a 3 year forward CAGR estimate for the growth rate.

Obvious still full of wildly sensitive assumptions, but isn't a DCF as well?

\>Fair Value = (P/E Ratio / PEG Ratio) × (EPS Growth Rate + Dividend Yield)

\>The calculator might estimate its fair value at $214.2 based on a P/E of 47.9, an EPS growth rate of 45.0%, and a dividend yield of 0.0%.

214.2 = (47.9 / 1.064) x 45

If you can tell me how he's getting those two sides to equal, I'd love to hear it.

It can also just mean that the earnings are shrinking. Which is quite common in cyclical markets.

PEG is an ok metric to put earnings, price and growth into one number, which works ok for growth stock. But if stock investing was as simple as looking at one number, the professionals would have already taken advantage of that number. 

There is no silver bullet.

Well said. That never stopped Wall Street though. The company that developed the first commercial predictive neural network model (the former HNC Software, now part of FICO, which used a neural network predictive model to predict credit card fraud) was approached by large Wall Street firms to develop a neural network model to predict the stock market. After a year of intensive research and modeling, HNC told them it was impossible because stock prices are impacted by far too many variables. 

Wall Street tried gaming the derivatives market with a simple algorithm. It was catastrophic. In 2008, this algorithm was a key reason for the stock market meltdown. 

Trying to do it the easy way has consequences.

Right now there isn’t a “clear” sight o their next area of the growth but they have been down this road. WBD though…..tough one

DIS/WB I would not hold any old media. I'm not even sure about Netflix. The lower barriers to entry in production, distribution and marketing are changing everything. The whole media landscape is going through massive disruption. Not just streaming, but the state of cinema, the internationalisation of cinema.

Apple: how many people care that much about the new iPhone, the new Mac? People are mostly binning them when they die.

Amazon/Microsoft and other cloud services. I'm not sure how much of these services are about actual growth based on increasing compute demands and how much is cloud migration. I have a feeling, the latter is a big part at which point, when everyone has migrated, growth will slow. Also, cloud competition is hotting up. All sorts of companies trying to eat into MS/AWS/Google. In particular Alibaba Cloud.

The Hershey guy is like my idol when it comes to incisiveness of valuation. Have you seen his write up? It's ridiculously in-depth.

I think there's nothing wrong with 10-20 positions. Being able to stomach the volatility of a concentrated portfolio and pick the component stocks well is probably a goal for beginners (like myself) rather than something we can do at the outset. 

Some news on Apple - China domestic consumers if it helps your analysis. I personally think the headlines aren't great, but I haven't done any due diligence on Apple itself.

Why are you looking at return on invested capital on companies that cannot generate more returns from reinvesting capital? Alphabet and Meta are internet tech companies that can only grow organically from more people using their respective products. These businesses cannot grow with capital, which is why they never dilute (sell off equity for capital) in the first place.

i’d sell both and keep the Meta and Google position. 

then put in the leg work for finding small caps. currently the entire market basically has a size premium. in other words, long big, short small. this has led to tremendous opportunities in the small cap space to find some companies trading at ridiculously cheap valuations or having very interesting catalysts.

however the entire S&P 500 is extremely concentrated in mag seven (about 20% of all their combined revenues risk). the mag seven as China market risk and are getting kicked by Huawei, TikTok, Alibaba, etc. and the think is, some of those companies are private! also, due to geopolitical tension, i wouldn’t touch Chinese equities with a 10 foot pole

Take it from a guy who’s doubled their money with Sable Offshore Corp and Sprout Farms after taking a 30% loss on paramount global and finished dumping Plantir at ridiculous valuations, etc. I know when i won, but I know when to call it quits. for these small caps you have to put in the leg work, since most of these are nothing burgers

i had invested in Paramount Global. sum of the parts thesis was obvious, but one controlling shareholder fucked everyone else over with an all equity dilutive reverse acquisition/merger.

i sold at a 30% loss and put it into smaller caps i had done lot’s of research and almost doubled my money (i.e. Sable Offshore Corp [still holding], Sprout Farms [now sold], and others i prefer not to share because i am still adding to my positions).

I consider media industry uninvestable as everyone is basically building from the ground up their advertising models, subscription tiers still changing l etc.

Netflix’ valuation also implies that each subscriber is worth $1,200 which is absurd. That per subscriber valuation assumes they will be subscribed basically forever or Netflix can somehow extract an absurd amount of advertising revenue even though a very big chunk of subscribers are ad free still.

Their capital goes into product development and R&D, expanding services internationally (think marketing services not their 'free' products). They grow revenue 20% yoy not because 20% more people show up on the internet each year (facebook user growth is low single digit %) but because they make more money \*per user\* each year through better ad conversion.

Most of disney's movies in the last 5 years were not profitable... at all. When a movie costs 400mil to make, in turn they need roughly 1.2bil. Movie costs triple from marketing and so forth, it's common math in the movie industry. Disney has been trash at movies, and nearly ruining some of the best IP out there (star wars). And yes, the lgbt stuff has turned off a ton of people.

Everyman do luxury cinemas in the UK. Really nice seats, drinks and food brought to you. It's a great experience. And I think that global cinema is going to be more and more of a thing, and so subtitling will hold up.

A guy around here that bought Hershey in 2023 (100% of portfolio) and now holds the bags.


It was a post about Hershey like one week ago and he was defending the company like his life depended on it 🤣


He also wrote a Scribd file with his "DD", around 20 pages of questions like "What products does it sell? Does it has high return on equity? Does it buyback shares? What risk does the company face?" Basically a 10-K in a different format.

Why wouldn't you just sell it now? Or why wouldn't you just say that AAPL seems to be your most over valued position currently. Because I don't disagree with you, I have a ton of AAPL too and I've been trimming it for 5 years now and would be perfectly fine selling more shares if I needed to. What I don't get is how people can say they are selling X stock this year or buying X stock this year but haven't done it already. If it requires a catalyst then that means any stock can be what you are selling in 2025 and any stock can be what you are buying with the right catalyst. Like do investors really do that? Tell themselves they are going to buy or sell a stock over time instead of having the price action of a stock dictate their sales? Or am I just arguing semantics like a dumbass?

Metas price to book is close to 10 and Alphabets is 8. These are assets light businesses by any objective measure. Asset light means they are capital light, therefore you cannot look at return on invested capital. It will swing wildly with just minor changes to net income.

I sold my 100% of my Apple and Disney shares 2 days ago and reduced Amazon by 25%, probably will reduce further. You're getting hung up on semantics for no reason.

But to some degree yes, buying and selling is an emotional process, it often feels better to enter/exit over time. 

Say I want a 10% position in some company. I will start with 1-2% and wait one quarter (at least long enough for one earning's cycle) and pay attention to how I feel about it. If the price goes down and I'm nervous that's a bad sign, if I'm excited because I can buy more for a lower price that's a good indication that I've done enough homework. If I was a robot, I would do my analysis and go all-in on one stock, but I'm a bag of mostly water that has to sleep at night, so I do this instead.

People lose money when they panic from uncertainty. You can tell yourself you won't panic, but it's far better to not get into such situations in the first place. This is the best way that I've found that works for me, ymmv.

Comment by HearAPianoFall at 2025-01-05 21:48:48+00:00:
Their book value is high because they don't capitalize R&D expenses which are massive, they are asset light only if you assume their R&D produces no asset value (other than patents which are accounted for).

You're not wrong that classical calculation of ROIC would swing wildly with net income, but they are very stable businesses and so classical ROIC is also stable, so it still works as a rough measure. But the proper thing to do would be to capitalize R&D, removing it from the expense list and amortize the spending. Estimating the useful lifespan of R&D is a wild guessing game, but it's far more accurate than treating it as an expense.

If you capitalize R&D rather than expensing it, their net margins also go from \~25% to 40%+ (GOOG) and from 35% to 58%+ (META).

You might like this book that talks about this

Where the Money Is: Value Investing in the Digital Age by Adam Seessel

Accounting practices are slow to adapt to new industries, GAAP still doesn't mandate capitalizing R&D, allowing situationally. But US tax law does require companies to amortize R&D expenses since 2022. This increases their near term tax liability (as per higher net margins), though the amortized amount can be deducted later.

Comment by Honestmonster at 2025-01-04 10:24:09+00:00:
So it is just semantics. But it's not for no reason, you clearly said selling but you meant sold. So you're misleading with semantics for no reason. Sounds like we are both partly guilty..

I agree with everything else you said. I've come up with my own ways to mitigate the bad emotions, as most good investors im sure do, but still understanding that the intuition of the subconscious is an amazing decision maker if you protect it. Buying and selling in increments helps a lot. It's essentially game theory. If I buy a small amount of shares, either it goes up and I did good or it goes down and I can buy at a better price. It may not mathematically give me an advantage over time but emotionally it puts me at a relative win-win every single time which protects my state of mind, which will make me process clearer information instead of being clouded by frustration or anger or eagerness and that definitely helps with long term returns. The average investor that doesn't prioritize protecting their mind will buy some shares, the stock goes down and they sell it or it goes up and they buy more then it goes down. Those people let the bad emotions take over.  

It may seem kind of silly to most but I never make any calculations really or do any technical analysis on a company. If I do it's usually because im arguing with someone on here and I have to prove them wrong I can't just say "trust me bro." I mostly just look at their financial statements, their charts, maybe listen to earnings calls, I naturally love understanding business models and strategy but you just kind absorb information and don't really try to qualify it because I know my subconscious feeling of taking all this information in about the company will be significantly more accurate than any formula or ratio someone creates to decide on their investments. I also know most people don't protect their intuition so it can become really clouded. And the more someone seeks out advice from other people or becomes beholden to formulas and patterns the more it will get clouded. 

This doesn't mean someone with clouded intuition can all of a sudden be very accurate with their feelings, but I do believe people can work on it. Unfortunately some people are also very dumb and it will never work for them and they should just index. But most people are smart enough cultivate it. 

With all that said my original problem with the semantics is when people say they want to buy X company this year, to me it's already setting them up to cloud their intuition because they are creating a desire. Which means their brain naturally goes to work to convince them to buy it over time regardless of buying opportunity or not, and because of that people have to start using formulas or peers opinions on reddit to try to counteract their bad thought process which ultimately just unravels into bad decision making. It's not their strategy or stocks that are wrong, it's their intuition calculator that's sabotaging them. 

The amount of people on here that hate a company/stock because of their personal feelings towards the company is staggering. It doesn't matter if you can afford a coffee at Starbucks or not, all that matters is how does Starbucks fit in the market place and what advantages do they have over their competitors. It doesn't matter if you think Crocs look stupid or you don't use Facebook anymore. Any insight that may give you to understanding the company will 100% sabotage any intuition you will get from analyzing the company. 

Ok I've typed way too much. Sorry if you read all that. Happy investing!

We can say that GAAP accounting has flaws and shortcomings but that doesn’t change the fact that these are software companies. The product is software, and the product primarily requires labor for production, not capital. Reinvesting capital
simply does not yield a return for these businesses. Most of the recent surge in CapEx is from mass spending on AI chips, which has not produced any return on capital as of yet. You have to understand that you should not look at capital at all when viewing software companies.

>You have to understand that you should not look at capital at all when viewing software companies.

I think you are sorely mistaken, I think it's possibly the most important thing when it comes to tech. You can think of it as human capital if you prefer. You can buy it by making capital outlays to acquire top talent, or you can spend time and money developing the knowledge in-house.

Those AI/ML research startups aren't spending those hundreds of millions on hardware I can tell you that.

Comment by Cueg at 2025-01-06 19:09:29+00:00:
Human labor is not capital. Labor is not owned like the product which it produces or the machines which it uses. Again, these companies have pitiful capital expenditures in relation to operating cash flow. You are using a metric which is simply wrong to use and you’re trying to justify using it with reasoning that isn’t even included in your numbers. Capital allocation is not important for them. The amount which they outlay towards CapEx is negligible towards their earnings. The assets which they own will produce around the same earnings whether or not they employ 15000 people or 50000. This is completely evident in the fact that Meta was able to fire 25% of its workforce over the last two years and still grow revenue over 30%. The very nature of software is that once it’s built you are done. Operating costs are at a minimum at that point and the software will produce x dollars with x users and 2x dollars with 2x users. Outlaying 2x in capital isn’t going to grow your user base. The software is a brand, not a technology where adding more functionality increases competitive advantage. There are a dozen search engines which are arguably better then google, and anybody can program an instagram application with very little resources. Again, these are brands like Warrens Sees Candy. They have nothing to do with the profits, and that’s why they throw it away in fruitless projects like Waymo and the Metaverse. The fact that you speak so highly of their capital allocation skills when they themselves say that it is their business model to throw away money into fruitless ventures because they have nothing to do with it is funny. You need to look at their EPS growth history and project that out into the future. They are not capital allocators and they are not in the business of allocating capital, so stop looking at it for your own sake.

No offense but as someone that works in the industry, I think you don't understand tech. You are conflating network effects with brand value. People in the US \*hate\* the Facebook brand. I'll leave it to you to figure out why they still use it.

Since you're going to deliberately mis-restate 'human capital' as 'human labor', I don't have any interest in continuing this discussion. Here is a definition that directly addresses human capital as it relates to the balance sheet.

Comment by Euthyphraud at 2025-01-01 18:41:33+00:00:
LDOS is a great company with very high growth at the moment. It took a real pounding when Trump was elected and appointed Musk and Ramaswamy co-heads of 'DOGE'. The theory is that companies with government contracts will see major reductions in contract opportunities moving forward.

This fear isn't unfounded. LDOS may take a hit from budget cuts, however being a defense oriented company likely means it is less likely to take a big hit than some other companies that do contract and advisory work for the US government. It is also looking overseas, especially to Europe where defense budgets are climbing fast. Now could be a very good time to buy.

I like AMZN as well. I worry about a possible recession and I really worry about the return of inflation due to tariffs. Consumer discretionary - a major part of their business - will take a hit. That said, I hold what I consider a full position (5%) of AMZN in my account. I'd consider it a hold right now, however.

A few I like: 

VRT is a strong choice for a play on data centers which is what they build. ETN is a larger and more diversified company dealing with data centers in terms of things like electrification.

I am rather optimistic about the real estate sector which I've largely avoided for the past two years. EQIX is expensive, but another good data center play. PLD has fallen too far and is in a strong technical position to rise quickly in the near future.

NVDA and AVGO remain legitimate choices as anchors for a portfolio right now. I hold both, I'm not buying more because they already exceed my 5% full position threshold which is where I will no longer buy more shares. 

After their drop, any of the big 5 semiconductor OEMs would be a nice choice - I'd only pick one: AMAT; LRCX; TOELY; KLAC; ASML. 

I actually really like SPOT and UBER as well. UBER finally became profitable and is expanding rapidly around the globe, and moving into new types of markets. SPOT is coming to dominate music streaming and is tariff-proof.

For AMZN - Having direct experience with their products as a data scientist gives you a valuable perspective. Just keep in mind to separate being a user from being an investor. Have you analyzed their AWS margins compared to their retail margins? That's often a key factor.

LDOS is interesting - for defense contractors, I always look at three key things:

* Contract backlog trends (shows future revenue visibility)
* Operating margins (shows pricing power on contracts)
* Free cash flow conversion (critical in this industry) Their recent contract wins are promising, but worth checking if they're maintaining margins on new bids.

For CKPT - While FDA approval is positive, have you looked at:

* Their cash runway
* Potential market size for UNlOCXyts
* Competition in that specific treatment area

I built [valu8.app](http://valu8.app) to track these kinds of metrics through weekly alerts, since fundamentals often tell us more than news headlines.

ASML is also the one I own, however any of the 5 is a still a great choice. KLAC is by far the largest leader on specialty testing equipment - a near monopoly though not on par with ASML's. LRCX, AMAT and TOELY all make multiple types of machines and are more generalists. That doesn't mean they don't have massive moats - these machines are still among the most advanced made by any company on Earth.

I also own TER which has a duopoly on parts of the advanced packaging sub-industry. They also are now making quite impressive AI-run robots that are gaining traction very quickly. Might be worth a look.

I understand what you see in the balance sheet. I haven't gotten involved as this voice in the back of my head says they're going to end up in the basement like Walgreens is today. Locally, WMT is advert same day delivery Rx although I haven't looked into it but do notice how the CVS section inside TGT is empty aisles, especially the ones that have ulta inside TGT. When I'm in standalone CVS there's customers but not too much activity at the registers. That's the depth of my channel checks.

CVS biggest money maker is their insurance business which reported declining net income last quarter. 

You should listen to their last earnings call. I closed my positions after that and this report: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-nationwide-lawsuit-alleging-cvs-knowingly-dispensed-controlled

They did shake up their leadership. Major issue is their struggling Aetna business due to possible (idk..) poor pricing. Although they call it high utilization which in the end just means they didn't make much money and spent a lot. This is the main reason the stock was dumped. 


Since you're just considering investing in them I'm just sharing my opinion. Happy to be proven wrong and I might buy them again.


Valuation is attractive, turnaround is uncertain.

I also almost fell into this stock last month, but after seeing the CEOs last interviews with ideas that failed to produce positive results and thinking about how ez it is today to get all our medicine by delivery through Amazon. I did some research and Amazon even has a full team of medical staff and pharmacist to assist you and get your medicine delivered same day. I know most of the people around me use delivery services vs going in-person and waiting in line. This is why I am staying away from this stock for now unless they become disruptive in their business model.

PBM are in the cross hairs. I still hold my position but frankly it’s not particularly attractive. Since legislation is unlikely for the time being it’s probably okay but price is more justified than it appears.

They don't know what they're doing there. They know that and pivoted to primary care with one medical.

Ah. I'm in the park that they're getting into too much stuff like GE once did when they peaked.

Wonder if AWS will be spun off over the next few years
